# SECTION 10: ONE-ON-ONES MASTERY
# ============================================================================

one_on_ones_mastery:
  
  philosophy: |
    One-on-ones are the most important meeting you have as a manager. They are where 
    you build relationships, provide coaching, hear problems early, and help people 
    grow. Skip your other meetings if you must, but never skip or reschedule 1-on-1s. 
    
    This is THEIR time, not yours. They set the agenda. You listen, coach, provide 
    context, and remove blockers. Done well, 1-on-1s are force multipliers. Done 
    poorly, they're wasted time that breeds resentment.
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # What One-on-Ones Are and Are Not
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  what_they_are_and_are_not:
    
    what_they_are:
      - "Dedicated time for direct report to talk about whatever they need"
      - "Opportunity to provide coaching and mentorship"
      - "Place to build trust and relationship"
      - "Forum to hear problems and concerns early"
      - "Time to provide context on company/team decisions"
      - "Career development discussions"
      - "Safe space to give and receive feedback"
    
    what_they_are_not:
      
      status_updates:
        wrong: "Tell me what you worked on this week and progress on your projects"
        why_wrong: "This is what Slack, email, and standup meetings are for. Waste of valuable 1-on-1 time."
        alternative: "I already know what you're working on from standups. What do you want to talk about?"
      
      your_agenda:
        wrong: "Here are 5 things I need to tell you about [company news, process changes, etc]"
        why_wrong: "This is their time, not yours. Send email or Slack if you need to broadcast information."
        alternative: "I have one thing I want to share (5 min). What's on your mind today?"
      
      performance_reviews:
        wrong: "Let me tell you what you're doing wrong and areas you need to improve"
        why_wrong: "Feedback should be continuous and in real-time, not saved for 1-on-1s. If you only give feedback in 1-on-1s, it creates anxiety."
        alternative: "Give feedback immediately when you observe something (good or concerning). 1-on-1s are for deeper career discussions."
      
      accountability_meetings:
        wrong: "Why didn't you finish X? What's taking so long on Y?"
        why_wrong: "Feels like interrogation. Creates adversarial dynamic. People will avoid being honest."
        alternative: "I noticed X is delayed. What's blocking you? How can I help?"
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Structure and Cadence
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  structure_and_cadence:
    
    frequency:
      
      weekly_cadence:
        recommendation: "Weekly for most reports"
        duration: "30 minutes (can extend to 60 if needed)"
        
        why_weekly:
          - "Catch problems early before they fester"
          - "Build relationship through consistent touchpoints"
          - "Show you care by making them a priority"
          - "Course correct quickly on work or concerns"
        
        when_biweekly_acceptable:
          - "Very senior engineers (L6+) who are highly autonomous"
          - "You have >10 direct reports and can't do weekly with everyone"
          - "Direct report explicitly prefers biweekly"
        
        never_monthly: "Monthly is too infrequent. You'll lose touch with what's happening."
      
      scheduling:
        same_time_every_week: "Tuesday 2:00 PM, every Tuesday, never move it"
        
        why_consistency_matters:
          - "Shows reliability and commitment"
          - "Becomes routine they can count on"
          - "Easier to prepare when it's always same time"
        
        what_if_conflict:
          reschedule_within_same_week: "If you must reschedule, do it within same week, not skip to next week"
          they_can_reschedule_you_cant: "They can reschedule if they need. You cannot reschedule unless emergency."
          never_cancel_repeatedly: "Canceling 1-on-1s repeatedly sends message: 'You're not important.'"
    
    location_and_format:
      
      in_person_options:
        office: "Default - private conference room, your office, or quiet space"
        walking_1_on_1: "30-min walk outside - good for relationship building, casual conversations, not for difficult topics"
        coffee_shop: "Occasionally for change of scenery, but ensure privacy for sensitive topics"
      
      remote_options:
        video_call: "Default - video on for both, builds rapport"
        phone_call: "If video issues, but prefer video"
        never_chat_only: "Slack/text is not a 1-on-1. Need real-time conversation."
      
      privacy_is_critical:
        - "Private space where others can't hear"
        - "Close door, book conference room"
        - "Don't do 1-on-1s in open office where others overhear"
        - "For remote, ensure both are in private space"
    
    agenda_ownership:
      
      they_own_the_agenda:
        principle: "This is THEIR time. They decide what to discuss."
        
        how_to_start: |
          "What's on your mind today?"
          "What do you want to talk about?"
          "What's most important for us to discuss?"
        
        if_they_say_nothing:
          dont_accept: "Don't accept 'nothing' as answer - probe gently"
          prompt: "Nothing going on? How are you feeling about work? Any concerns or questions?"
          share_prompts: "At beginning of relationship, share potential topics they could bring"
      
      you_can_add_topics:
        when: "After they've shared what's on their mind"
        how: "I have one thing I want to discuss (should take 5-10 min). Is that okay?"
        
        your_typical_topics:
          - "Provide context on company/team decisions"
          - "Share feedback (positive or constructive)"
          - "Discuss upcoming projects or priorities"
          - "Career development check-in"
    
    common_agenda_topics:
      
      from_them:
        - "Blockers on current work - need your help removing"
        - "Concerns about project direction or priorities"
        - "Team dynamics or interpersonal issues"
        - "Career growth and development questions"
        - "Feedback for you on management style"
        - "Work-life balance concerns"
        - "Questions about company strategy or decisions"
        - "Ideas for improvements to team or processes"
      
      from_you:
        - "Context on why certain decisions were made"
        - "Feedback on recent work (specific examples)"
        - "Career development check-ins"
        - "Upcoming changes that affect them"
        - "Recognition for great work"
        - "Asking for their input on team decisions"

  # Making One-on-Ones Effective
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  making_them_effective:
    
    your_role_as_manager:
      
      listen_more_than_talk:
        ratio: "They should talk 70%, you talk 30%"
        
        why: "You learn by listening. They benefit from being heard."
        
        techniques:
          - "Ask open-ended questions, not yes/no questions"
          - "Pause after they finish speaking - don't immediately respond"
          - "Paraphrase to confirm understanding: 'So what I'm hearing is...'"
          - "Ask follow-up questions to go deeper"
      
      be_present:
        what_it_means:
          - "No laptop open, no phone checking"
          - "Full attention on them"
          - "Make eye contact"
          - "Show you're engaged through body language and responses"
        
        if_you_need_to_take_notes:
          - "Tell them why: 'I'm taking notes so I remember to follow up on this'"
          - "Use notebook or tablet, not laptop (less barrier between you)"
          - "Write quick notes, don't transcribe everything"
      
      ask_good_questions:
        
        open_ended_questions:
          - "How are you feeling about [project/situation]?"
          - "What's been most challenging this week?"
          - "What would make you more effective?"
          - "How can I better support you?"
          - "What's one thing we should change about how the team works?"
        
        probing_questions:
          - "Tell me more about that"
          - "What makes you say that?"
          - "What would ideal outcome look like?"
          - "What have you tried so far?"
        
        avoid_yes_no_questions:
          bad: "Is everything going okay?"
          better: "How are things going? What's going well and what's challenging?"
      
      provide_context:
        what: "Explain the 'why' behind decisions, not just the 'what'"
        
        example: |
          Instead of: "We're changing our sprint planning process"
          
          Say: "We're changing sprint planning because the current process takes 2 hours 
          and people feel like it's not productive time. The new process should be faster 
          and give you more autonomy on task breakdown. Here's what's changing and why..."
        
        why_context_matters: "People are more bought-in when they understand reasoning. Reduces feeling of arbitrary decisions."
      
      be_honest:
        what: "Don't sugarcoat or hide information"
        
        example_good: "Honestly, I don't know yet. That decision is above my level. But I'll find out and let you know."
        
        example_bad: "Everything's fine, nothing to worry about" (when actually company is struggling)
        
        why: "Trust is built on honesty. People can handle truth. They can't handle being lied to or kept in dark."
    
    taking_action_on_1_on_1s:
      
      take_notes:
        what_to_capture:
          - "Action items for you"
          - "Action items for them"
          - "Topics to revisit next time"
          - "Concerns or themes that emerge over time"
        
        where_to_take_notes:
          - "Shared doc (Google Doc) both can access and add to"
          - "Your private notes for sensitive topics"
          - "Task tracker for action items"
      
      follow_through:
        critical: "If you say you'll do something, DO IT"
        
        examples:
          - "You said you'll look into that bug → actually look into it"
          - "You said you'll talk to other team about dependency → actually do it"
          - "You said you'll find answer to their question → find the answer"
        
        if_you_forget: "You lose credibility. They stop bringing up issues because 'nothing happens anyway.'"
        
        system: "Track action items in task list. Review before each 1-on-1 to ensure you've done what you said."
      
      revisit_previous_topics:
        why: "Shows you remember and care about things that matter to them"
        
        example: |
          "Last time you mentioned struggling with work-life balance. How's that going 
          this week? Did the changes we discussed help?"
        
        use_shared_doc: "Shared doc makes it easy to see what you discussed previously"

  # Difficult Conversations in One-on-Ones

  difficult_conversations:
    
    delivering_critical_feedback:
      
      when: "As soon as possible after you observe the issue, don't wait for 1-on-1"
      
      but_if_in_1_on_1:
        structure:
          observation: "Here's what I observed [specific behavior]"
          impact: "Here's the impact [on team, project, others]"
          expectation: "Here's what I expect instead"
          support: "How can I help you improve this?"
        
        example: |
          "In yesterday's code review, I noticed you dismissed Sarah's feedback pretty 
          quickly without really engaging with her points. Sarah felt like her input 
          wasn't valued, and she mentioned it to me. I need you to engage more 
          thoughtfully with feedback, even when you disagree. Can you tell me your 
          perspective? And how can we make sure this doesn't happen again?"
      
      what_not_to_do:
        - "Don't use 'feedback sandwich' (positive-negative-positive) - it's dishonest and confusing"
        - "Don't be vague ('you need to communicate better') - be specific"
        - "Don't compare to other team members ('Sarah doesn't have this problem')"
        - "Don't make it personal ('you're careless') - focus on behavior"
    
    receiving_difficult_feedback:
      
      they_give_you_feedback:
        your_response: "Thank them. Take it seriously. Don't get defensive."
        
        good_response: |
          "Thank you for telling me this. I really appreciate you being direct. Let me 
          think about what you said. Can we talk more about this next time so I can 
          understand better and figure out how to improve?"
        
        bad_response: |
          "That's not really accurate. Let me explain why I do things that way..."
          (This is defensive and will make them never give you feedback again)
        
        follow_up: "Actually change based on feedback. Show them their feedback matters."
    
    they_are_unhappy_or_frustrated:
      
      listen_first:
        - "Let them vent if they need to"
        - "Don't immediately try to fix or explain"
        - "Acknowledge their feelings: 'I can see you're frustrated. That makes sense given [situation].'"
      
      understand_root_cause:
        questions:
          - "What's most frustrating about this?"

          - "What would need to be different for you to stay?"
        
        step_2_evaluate:
          - "Is this solvable? (compensation, role scope, team dynamics)"
          - "Is this unsolvable? (want different career path, personal reasons, company stage)"

  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  common_mistakes:
    
    canceling_or_rescheduling_frequently:
      problem: "Sends message: 'You're not a priority. Other things matter more.'"
      impact: "Trust erodes. They stop bringing up issues. Relationship suffers."
      fix: "Treat 1-on-1s as sacred. Reschedule your other meetings, not these."
    
    making_it_all_status_updates:
      problem: "Wastes valuable time on information you could get asynchronously"
      impact: "They see no value in 1-on-1s. Becomes box-checking exercise."
      fix: "Start with 'I already know your status from Slack. What do YOU want to talk about?'"
    
    doing_all_the_talking:
      problem: "You talk for 25 minutes, they get 5 minutes"
      impact: "They feel unheard. You don't learn what's actually happening."
      fix: "Force yourself to listen more. Count to 5 before responding. Ask questions instead of giving answers."
    
    not_taking_notes_or_following_up:
      problem: "You forget what you discussed. Action items don't happen."
      impact: "They stop sharing issues because nothing changes."
      fix: "Take notes. Track action items. Review before next 1-on-1. Follow through."
    
    being_on_laptop_or_phone:
      problem: "Distracted, not present, sends message they're not important"
      impact: "They shut down. Conversations become superficial."
      fix: "Close laptop. Put phone away. Give full attention. This is the most important meeting you have."
    
    only_talking_about_work:
      problem: "Never ask about them as person - their life, interests, challenges"
      impact: "Relationship remains transactional. No real trust or connection."
      fix: "Ask about their life occasionally (but don't pry). Show you care about them as humans, not just workers."
    
    avoiding_difficult_topics:
      problem: "Dance around issues, sugarcoat feedback, avoid conflict"
      impact: "Problems fester. They don't improve because they don't know there's issue."
      fix: "Be direct but kind. Address issues promptly. Difficult conversations get easier with practice."
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "1-on-1s are most important meeting you have - never cancel or reschedule unless emergency"
    - "This is THEIR time, not yours - they set agenda, you listen and coach"
    - "Weekly 30 min is standard - same time every week, never move it"
    - "Listen 70%, talk 30% - you learn by listening, they benefit from being heard"
    - "Not for status updates - get that async. 1-on-1s for coaching, feedback, career, blockers"
    - "Be fully present - no laptop, no phone, full attention"
    - "Take notes and follow through on action items - credibility depends on it"
    - "Difficult conversations: be direct but kind, address issues promptly"
    - "If they give you feedback about your management, thank them and actually change"
    - "Common mistakes: canceling frequently, making it status updates, doing all talking, not following up"
