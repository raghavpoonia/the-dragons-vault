# SECTION 21: SCALING FROM 5 TO 15 PEOPLE
# ============================================================================

scaling_5_to_15_people:
  
  philosophy: |
    Managing 5 people is fundamentally different from managing 15. At 5 people, you can 
    know everything happening on the team, be involved in all decisions, and maintain 
    direct relationships with everyone. At 15 people, this breaks down. You need 
    structure, delegation, and leadership layers. Many managers fail at this transition.
    
    The transition from 5 to 15 people forces you to: introduce management layers (tech 
    leads or managers), systematize processes, delegate decision-making, and accept you 
    can't be involved in everything. This is uncomfortable but necessary for scale.

          - "Chinese telephone game - information corrupts as it passes through people"

          - "Must delegate or become bottleneck"
        
        result: "You need to introduce leadership layers and delegate"
      
      decision_making:
        at_5_people:
          - "Consensus or manager decision works fine"
          - "5 people can discuss and align quickly"

        at_15_people:
          - "Consensus is impossible - too many opinions"
          - "Meetings with 15 people are useless"
          - "People feel unheard if every decision requires everyone"
        
        result: "You need clear decision-making framework and delegation"
      
      culture:
        at_5_people:
          - "Culture emerges organically"

          - "Team waits days for your review or approval"
          - "Projects stall waiting for you"
          - "You're exhausted and team is frustrated"
        
        outcome: "You burn out. Team velocity collapses. People quit."
      
      the_abdicator:
        what: "Manager throws up hands and stops managing as complexity grows"
        
        symptoms:
          - "You're rarely available"
          - "Don't know what team is working on"
          - "Avoid difficult decisions or conversations"
          - "Team directionless and chaotic"

      the_micromanager:
        what: "Manager tries to control everything as team grows to maintain control"
        
        symptoms:
          - "You're in every meeting, reviewing every decision"
          - "Team can't make any decisions without you"
          - "You're prescribing implementation details"
          - "Team frustrated and infantilized"

            This doesn't mean she's 'better' than anyone else - we just need management

  key_takeaways:
    - "5 to 15 people is critical transition - what worked at 5 breaks at 15 due to communication overhead and manager capacity"
    - "Common failure modes: bottleneck (try to stay in everything), abdicator (give up managing), micromanager (control everything)"
    - "Introduce tech leads at 8-10 people: senior engineers who provide technical leadership without people management"
    - "Tech leads decide: technical approach, quality standards, day-to-day priorities in their domain"
    - "Add second manager at 12-15 people: split team by domain, promote internal tech lead or hire external"
    - "Establish systematic processes: work intake, code review, incident response, knowledge management, change management"
    - "Communication at scale: weekly team meeting, tech lead sync, written updates, clear channels and documentation"
    - "Maintain culture actively: define values explicitly, onboarding as culture transmission, social connection, address violations"
    - "You must delegate decision-making and accept you can't be involved in everything - this is uncomfortable but necessary"
    - "Tech lead role is training ground for senior IC or management track - invest in developing them as leaders"
