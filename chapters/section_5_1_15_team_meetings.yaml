running_effective_team_meetings:
  
  philosophy: |
    Meetings are expensive - 8 people in a 1-hour meeting is 8 hours of engineering time. 
    Most meetings are wasteful because they lack clear purpose, structure, or follow-through. 
    Your job as manager is to run meetings that are worth the time investment.
    
    Good meetings have clear objectives, engaged participants, and actionable outcomes. 
    Bad meetings are status updates that could have been emails, rambling discussions that 
    go nowhere, or theater where real work happens in backchannels afterward.

  # Meeting Audit - What Meetings Do You Actually Need?
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  meeting_audit:
    
    common_meetings_and_their_value:
      
      daily_standup:
        purpose: "Quick sync on what people are working on, identify blockers"
        duration: "15 minutes MAX"
        frequency: "Daily"
        
        value_if_done_well: "High - catches blockers early, keeps team aligned"
        value_if_done_poorly: "Low - becomes boring status update theater"
        
        keep_or_kill: "Keep if team is collaborative and working on interdependent work. Kill if everyone works independently."
      
      weekly_team_meeting:
        purpose: "Deeper discussions, demos, learning, team bonding"
        duration: "60 minutes"
        frequency: "Weekly"
        
        value_if_done_well: "High - builds team cohesion, shares knowledge, discusses meaty topics"
        value_if_done_poorly: "Low - becomes status update meeting or rambling discussion"
        
        keep_or_kill: "Keep. This is valuable if you run it well (see structure below)."
      
      sprint_planning:
        purpose: "Decide what to work on next sprint"
        duration: "60-90 minutes"
        frequency: "Biweekly (or whatever sprint cadence)"
        
        value_if_done_well: "High - team aligned on priorities, work is scoped and estimated"
        value_if_done_poorly: "Low - takes 3 hours, people tune out, priorities unclear"
        
        keep_or_kill: "Keep if doing agile/scrum. Streamline if taking too long."
      
      retrospective:
        purpose: "Reflect on what's working and what needs improvement"
        duration: "45-60 minutes"
        frequency: "Every 2-4 weeks"
        
        value_if_done_well: "Very high - team continuously improves processes"
        value_if_done_poorly: "Low - becomes complaining session with no action"
        
        keep_or_kill: "Keep. Essential for continuous improvement."
      
      all_hands_or_status_update_meeting:
        purpose: "Manager updates team on company/org news"
        duration: "30 minutes"
        frequency: "Weekly or biweekly"
        
        value_if_done_well: "Medium - keeps team informed of context"
        value_if_done_poorly: "Low - information could have been email"
        
        keep_or_kill: "Kill and replace with written update. Or keep very short (15 min) and make it Q&A focused."
    
    meeting_cost_calculation:
      
      example:
        meeting: "Weekly team meeting"
        attendees: "8 people"
        duration: "60 minutes"
        frequency: "52 times per year"
        
        annual_cost:
          hours: "8 people × 1 hour × 52 weeks = 416 hours"
          weeks_of_work: "416 hours ÷ 40 hours/week = 10.4 weeks"
          full_time_equivalent: "10.4 weeks ÷ 52 weeks = 0.2 FTE = 20% of one engineer"
        
        question: "Is this meeting worth 20% of an engineer's annual output?"
    
    when_to_kill_a_meeting:
      - "Agenda is consistently 'does anyone have anything?' and nobody does"
      - "More than 30% of attendees are on laptops doing other work"
      - "Decisions made in meeting get overridden in backchannels after"
      - "Information could be communicated asynchronously (email, Slack, doc)"
      - "Meeting exists because 'we've always had it' with no clear purpose"
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Daily Standup
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  daily_standup:
    
    purpose: "Quick synchronization, not detailed status update"
    
    format:
      
      classic_three_questions:
        - "What did you do yesterday?"
        - "What will you do today?"
        - "Any blockers?"
        
        problems:
          - "Becomes rote recitation, people tune out"
          - "Updates not relevant to most people"
          - "Takes too long as team grows"
      
      better_format_blockers_first:
        structure:
          - "Anyone blocked on anything? (2 minutes)"
          - "Any help needed from team? (2 minutes)"
          - "Quick round-robin updates only if relevant to others (5 minutes MAX)"
        
        why_better:
          - "Focuses on what matters - unblocking people"
          - "People only speak if they have something relevant"
          - "Stays under 10 minutes even with 8 people"
      
      best_format_async_written_standup:
        what: "Everyone posts update in Slack by 10 AM, no meeting"
        
        format: |
          Yesterday: [what you did]
          Today: [what you're doing]
          Blockers: [anything blocking you or FYI for team]
        
        benefits:
          - "No meeting time wasted"
          - "People can read updates when convenient"
          - "Written record searchable later"
          - "Introverts prefer this"
        
        when_to_still_meet: "Only if team has discussion topic or blocker that needs real-time conversation"
    
    standup_anti_patterns:
      
      status_report_to_manager:
        problem: "People direct updates to manager, not to each other"
        fix: "Rotate who runs standup. Manager should speak last, not first."
      
      takes_30_minutes:
        problem: "Too long, people mentally check out"
        fix: "Timebox to 15 minutes total. Cut off tangents: 'Let's take that offline.'"
      
      problem_solving_in_standup:
        problem: "Someone mentions issue, team spends 15 minutes debugging in standup"
        fix: "Note the issue, schedule separate discussion with only relevant people"
      
      remote_people_forgotten:
        problem: "In-person standup, remote people join video but get ignored"
        fix: "Everyone joins from their desk on video, or everyone in room together (no hybrid)"

  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "Meetings are expensive - 8 people × 1 hour = 8 hours of engineering time, use wisely"
    - "Audit your meetings: kill meetings where agenda is 'does anyone have anything?' and nobody does"
    - "Daily standup: keep under 15 min, focus on blockers, consider async written updates instead"
    - "Weekly team meeting: 60 min with wins/celebrations (15 min), main topic deep dive (30 min), discussion, action items"
    - "Rotate responsibilities: different people facilitate, present, take notes - develops team and builds ownership"
    - "Sprint planning: groom backlog before meeting, team commits to work (not manager dictates), identify risks"
    - "Retrospectives: what went well, what could be better, 2-3 action items with owners, actually follow through"
    - "Facilitation skills: manage dominant speakers, draw out quiet people, timebox discussions, use parking lot for tangents"
    - "Decision making: clarify decision type upfront, use consent not consensus, disagree and commit"
    - "Start and end on time, make meetings engaging with variety, cancel if no good topics rather than waste time"
