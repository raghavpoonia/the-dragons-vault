# SECTION 06: INTERVIEW PROCESS DESIGN
# ============================================================================

interview_process_design:
  
  philosophy: |
    Your interview process is a signal about your team. A sloppy, inconsistent process 
    signals dysfunction. A thoughtful, rigorous process signals excellence. Strong 
    candidates are interviewing you as much as you're interviewing them.
    
    The goal is to evaluate candidates fairly while selling them on the opportunity. 
    You're looking for signal on: technical ability, learning trajectory, collaboration, 
    communication, and values alignment.

  # Five to Six Stage Process
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  five_to_six_stage_process:
    
    stage_1_recruiter_screen:
      duration: "30 minutes"
      interviewer: "Recruiter or recruiting coordinator"
      timing: "Within 3-5 days of application"
      
      purpose: "Basic qualification, logistics, compensation alignment"
      
      recruiter_evaluates:
        - "Resume matches job requirements (years of experience, skills, domain)"
        - "Candidate interested in role and company (not just applying everywhere)"
        - "Compensation expectations realistic for level and market"
        - "Can work in required location/timezone"
        - "Eligible to work (visa status, etc)"
      
      red_flags_to_filter:
        - "Compensation expectations 50%+ above budget (won't close)"
        - "Can't start for 6+ months (will accept another offer first)"
        - "Wants remote but role is on-site (or vice versa)"
        - "Seems disinterested or applying to hundreds of jobs"
      
      what_recruiter_shares:
        - "Role overview (2-3 sentences on what team does)"
        - "Team structure and mission"
        - "Interview process and timeline (set expectations)"
        - "Compensation range (if legally required or company policy)"
      
      outcome: "Pass to hiring manager screen (60-70%) or polite rejection"
      
      common_mistakes:
        - "Recruiter doesn't understand technical requirements - passes unqualified candidates"
        - "No compensation discussion - waste everyone's time if misaligned"
        - "Takes too long to schedule - strong candidates accept other offers"
      
      best_practice: "Train recruiters on technical requirements. Share example resumes of good vs bad fits."
    
    stage_2_hiring_manager_screen:
      duration: "30-45 minutes"
      interviewer: "You (the hiring manager)"
      timing: "Within 5-7 days of recruiter screen"
      
      purpose: "Evaluate trajectory, assess cultural fit, build rapport, sell the role"
      
      structure:
        minutes_0_to_10_sell_the_role:
          why_important: "Candidates are interviewing you too. Start by exciting them."
          
          what_to_cover:
            - "Why you're excited about the team's mission"
            - "Interesting problems you're working on (be specific)"
            - "Growth opportunities for this role"
            - "Your management philosophy (briefly - 2 sentences)"
          
          example_pitch: |
            "We're building detection capabilities from scratch. In 12 months, we've gone 
            from 0 to 150 detections covering 70% of MITRE ATT&CK. The challenge is 
            scaling to 500+ while maintaining quality. You'd own cloud detection strategy 
            - AWS, Azure, GCP. We're also building detection-as-code platform. If you join, 
            you'll have significant autonomy and impact. I believe in growing people - 3 of 
            my team have been promoted in last 18 months."

              - "Do they listen or just wait to talk?"
              - "Are they defensive when challenged?"
              - "Can they admit when they don't know something?"
            
            technique: "Ask them to explain a complex topic, then ask clarifying questions that probe understanding"
          
          assess_values_alignment:
            what_to_evaluate:
              - "Do they value learning and growth?"

          bad_questions_indicate:
            - "Only asking about compensation/benefits - money focused only"
            - "No questions at all - not curious or already decided"
            - "Questions easily answered by website - didn't prepare"
      
      common_hiring_manager_mistakes:
        talking_too_much:

        ignoring_red_flags:
          problem: "You're desperate to fill role, so you rationalize away concerns"
          fix: "No hire is better than bad hire - ALWAYS. If you have concerns, explore them or reject."
      
      outcome: "Pass to technical interviews (50-60%) or polite rejection"
      
      rejection_criteria:
        - "Poor communication - can't explain their work clearly"
        - "No learning signal - hasn't grown in years"
        - "Values misalignment - blames others, defensive, arrogant"
        - "Low motivation - just wants any job, not this specific role"
        - "Red flags - inconsistent stories, badmouthing previous employers excessively"

            deep_dive_questions: "40-45 minutes - interviewer asks probing questions"
          
          what_to_evaluate:

            - "Can't answer alternatives - only knows one way to do things"
            - "Blames others for failures - team didn't help, manager didn't support"
            - "Doesn't know technical details of own project - might not have actually done it"
        
        option_2_live_coding_security_problem:

            too_much_help: "Basically solve it for them - can't evaluate their skills"
          
          right_approach: |
            Problem should be achievable in 30-40 minutes by competent candidate. Give hints 
            if stuck >5 minutes on something not core to evaluation. Focus on thought process, 
            not perfect solution. Working code with some bugs is fine - can discuss improvements.
