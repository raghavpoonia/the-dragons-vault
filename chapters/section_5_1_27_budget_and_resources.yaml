# SECTION 27: BUDGET AND RESOURCE PLANNING
# ============================================================================

budget_and_resource_planning:
  
  philosophy: |
    As manager, you're responsible for team's budget - headcount, tools, training, etc. 
    This is typically 70-90% people costs, 10-30% tools and infrastructure. Understanding 
    budgets, planning effectively, and justifying requests is critical management skill.
    
    Most engineers hate budget discussions - too corporate, too political. But budget is 
    how you translate technical needs into business language. Want that new tool? Need 
    two more engineers? Better learn to build compelling business case with ROI.

    budget_components:
      
      people_costs:
        what: "Salary, benefits, taxes, overhead for all team members"
        
        typical_percentage: "70-90% of total budget"
        
        calculation:
          base_salary: "$150K (example for L4 engineer)"
          benefits_and_taxes: "~30% of base = $45K"
          overhead_allocation: "~20% of loaded cost = $39K (HR, facilities, IT, etc)"
          fully_loaded_cost: "$234K per engineer per year"
        
        note: "Fully loaded cost is 1.5-1.6x base salary typically"
        
        your_team_cost:
          example:
            team_of_8: "8 × $234K = $1.87M per year"

        typical_allocation: "$2K-$5K per person per year"
        
        example:
          team_of_8: "8 × $3K = $24K/year"
          conferences: "2-3 people to Black Hat ($5K each) = $15K"
          online_training: "Team licenses for training platforms = $5K"

        what: "AWS/Azure/GCP costs for security infrastructure"
        
        typical: "$20K-$100K/year depending on scale"
        
        examples:
          - "Test environment for detection development"
          - "Log storage and processing"
          - "Security data lake"
      
      contingency:
        what: "Buffer for unexpected costs"
        
        typical: "10% of total budget"

        executive_summary: |
          Requesting 3 additional engineers ($702K) and $160K tools budget to close 
          critical security gaps. This investment enables SOC 2 compliance (required 
          for $5M customer deal), reduces breach risk by 60% (expected value $1.8M), 
          and makes team 2x more productive through automation. Total ROI: 5.4x in year 1.
        
        business_context: |
          We have critical gaps in cloud security (60% covered, need 90%) and detection 
          infrastructure is manual/slow. This blocks SOC 2 compliance, exposes us to 
          preventable breaches, and limits team productivity. Current team at 100% 
          capacity - can't address gaps without additional resources.
        
        proposed_solution: |
          Year 1:
          - Hire 2 cloud security engineers (Q1) - close coverage gaps, achieve compliance
          - Hire 1 platform engineer (Q2) - build detection automation platform
          - Purchase cloud security platform ($75K) - immediate visibility
          - Purchase threat intel feeds ($25K) - improve detection quality
          - Additional tool scaling ($60K) - support growth

      problem: "Q4 comes, finance asks for next year budget, you scramble"
      
      fix: "Start planning 3-4 months before budget cycle (July-Aug for Jan start)"

  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "Budget components: 70-90% people (fully loaded cost = 1.5-1.6x base salary), 10-25% tools, 2-3% training, plus contingency"
    - "Fully loaded cost example: $150K base → $234K total (benefits, taxes, overhead)"
    - "Annual planning happens Q4 for next year - start preparing 3-4 months early (July-Aug)"
    - "Headcount justification: workload-based (need X more for Y work), opportunity cost (prevents Z investment), risk-based (mitigates $X expected loss)"
    - "Tools justification: ROI calculation (cost vs benefit), build-vs-buy economics, time-to-value"
    - "Business case template: executive summary, business context, proposed solution, cost breakdown, ROI, alternatives, risks of not approving"
    - "Track spending monthly: people (predictable), tools (watch for overages), discretionary (training/travel)"
    - "Making trade-offs: hiring delays = savings for tools, cost overruns = cut elsewhere or request additional budget"
    - "Common mistakes: not planning ahead, asking without justification, underestimating fully-loaded costs, not tracking spend, not using allocated budget"
    - "Remember: 'Use it or lose it' - spend your budget or justify why you didn't, or it gets cut next year"
