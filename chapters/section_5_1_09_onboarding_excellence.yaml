# SECTION 09: ONBOARDING EXCELLENCE
# ============================================================================

onboarding_excellence:
  
  philosophy: |
    Onboarding is not HR paperwork - it's the foundation for someone's success on your 
    team. A great onboarding experience builds confidence, accelerates productivity, and 
    creates strong relationships. A poor onboarding experience creates doubt, delays 
    impact, and can cause good hires to leave within months.
    
    Your goal: Make new hire productive, confident, and excited within 90 days.

        duration: "30 minutes"
        
        you_greet_them: "Be there when they arrive - don't have them wait in lobby. Shows they matter."
        
        what_to_do:
          - "Warm welcome - smile, handshake, enthusiasm"
          - "Quick office tour (bathrooms, kitchen, emergency exits, conference rooms)"
          - "Get them settled at desk"
          - "Offer coffee/tea/water"
          - "Introduce to people you pass in hallway"
        
        tone: "Relaxed, welcoming, not rushed. First 30 minutes sets the tone for everything."
      
      9_30am_hr_onboarding:

        what: "HR handles paperwork, benefits enrollment, policies"
        
        your_role: "Make sure HR is prepared. Check in after to see if they have questions."
        
        common_issues:
          - "HR runs over time - be flexible with rest of schedule"
          - "Benefits are confusing - offer to help them understand options later"

              - "What you value (ownership, learning, communication)"
              - "How we'll work together (1-on-1s, feedback, autonomy)"
            
            example: |
              "Here's how I manage: I believe in giving you autonomy to make decisions. 
              I'm here to unblock you, provide context, and help you grow - not to 
              micromanage. I value ownership, learning, and clear communication. If 
              you're stuck, ask for help immediately - that's not weakness, that's smart.
              
              We'll do weekly 1-on-1s every [day] for 30 minutes. That's YOUR time - 
              you set the agenda. I'll ask how I can help, give you context on company 
              things, but mostly it's for you."

              first_90_days: "Autonomous on well-defined tasks. Ship quality work. Part of team rhythm."
            
            what_success_looks_like: |
              "Success at 90 days means:
              - You're comfortable asking questions and finding answers
              - You've shipped 2-3 small projects with quality
              - You know the team and how we work together
              - You're excited about the work and feel like you belong
              
              Success does NOT mean:
              - You know everything - impossible
              - You're as productive as people here 2 years - unrealistic
              - You've shipped major features - we're investing in you, not expecting miracles"

              Your first detection for credential dumping was solid - good logic, well 
              documented. You're collaborating well with the team.
              
              Areas for growth: I'd like to see you take more initiative on testing. 
              Right now you're waiting for someone to review before testing thoroughly

          response: |
            Totally normal for complex role. Some people take 60-90 days to ramp. 
            Extend learning period. Check if they need more support or different 
            approach. Don't panic yet.

            Great! Give them more challenging work. Be careful not to overload them - 
            they might be working too hard to prove themselves. Watch for burnout.

            Address directly in 30-day review. Be specific about behaviors that concern 
            you. Give them chance to adjust. If behavior continues, may not work out - 
            better to know at 30 days than 6 months.

  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "Onboarding starts 2 weeks before day 1 - prepare workstation, create accounts, assign buddy"
    - "Day 1 is about welcome and excitement, not productivity - be there when they arrive"
    - "Week 1 goals: feel welcome, understand mission, set up tools, learn people - no shipping expected"
    - "Assign onboarding buddy (peer, not manager, not most senior) for daily questions"
    - "First project should be small, low-risk, well-defined, completable in 2-3 weeks"
    - "30-day checkpoint: give feedback, get feedback, set goals for next 60 days"
    - "90-day review is critical: success (70-80%), needs improvement (15-20%), not working out (5-10%)"
    - "If not working out at 90 days, better to part ways than struggle for years with wrong hire"
    - "Great onboarding builds confidence, accelerates productivity, creates strong relationships"
    - "Poor onboarding creates doubt, delays impact, causes good hires to leave within months"
