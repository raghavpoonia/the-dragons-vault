# ============================================================================

managing_up:
  
  philosophy: |
    Managing up is not manipulation or politics - it's making your manager successful 
    by giving them what they need. Your manager's success is tied to your success. 
    Help them look good, reduce their surprises, provide them context, and ask for 
    what you need clearly.
    
    Many engineers resist "managing up" because it feels political. But your manager 
    has constraints, pressures, and blind spots you don't see. Understanding their 
    world and working with them effectively is a professional skill that accelerates 
    your career and makes both of you more successful.

  # Understanding Your Manager
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  understanding_your_manager:
    
    their_priorities:
      
      what_they_care_about:
        - "What are their goals for the year?"
        - "What metrics do they report to their boss?"
        - "What keeps them up at night?"
        - "What would make them look good to leadership?"
      
      how_to_learn_this:
        ask_directly: "In 1-on-1: 'What are your top priorities this quarter? How can I help?'"
        observe: "What do they talk about in team meetings? What gets their attention?"
        listen_in_skip_levels: "When your skip-level manager talks, what do they care about?"
      
      align_your_work: "Frame your work in terms of their priorities, not just what you find interesting"
    
    their_communication_style:
      
      preferences_to_learn:
        - "Do they prefer email, Slack, or in-person conversations?"
        - "Do they want detailed updates or high-level summaries?"
        - "Do they want solutions or just awareness of problems?"
        - "Morning person or afternoon person for important discussions?"
      
      ask_directly: "What's the best way to keep you informed? How much detail do you want?"
      
      adapt_to_their_style:
        if_they_want_details: "Give them details - send weekly written updates with specifics"
        if_they_want_high_level: "Lead with TL;DR, details available if they ask"
        if_they_hate_surprises: "Over-communicate, give heads up early on potential issues"
        if_they_love_solutions: "Don't bring problems without proposed solutions"
    
    their_constraints:
      
      what_they_cant_control:
        - "Budget limitations"
        - "Company-wide policies"
        - "Decisions from their leadership"
        - "Competing priorities from other teams"
      
      why_this_matters: "When they say 'no' to something you want, it's often constraints, not that they don't value you"
      
      empathy: "They're juggling 5 teams' needs, leadership pressure, budget cuts, and politics you don't see"
    
    their_blind_spots:
      
      common_manager_blind_spots:
        - "Don't know day-to-day execution details (they're abstracted from the work)"
        - "Don't know morale is low until it's very bad"
        - "Don't know person is about to quit until they give notice"
        - "Don't know technical decisions have downstream problems"
      
      your_role: "Surface these things proactively - be their eyes and ears on the ground"
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Communication Tactics
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  communication_tactics:
    
    no_surprises_rule:
      
      principle: "Your manager should never be surprised by something their boss asks them about"
      
      what_to_share_proactively:
        - "Major incidents or outages"
        - "Risks to team goals or projects"
        - "Team morale issues or interpersonal conflicts"
        - "Someone on team likely to quit"
        - "External stakeholder complaints"
        - "Anything that could escalate to their level"
      
      when_to_share: "As soon as you know, not when it becomes a crisis"
      
      how_to_share: |
        "Heads up: we had a production incident yesterday that affected 500 users for 2 hours. 
        It's resolved now. Root cause was [X]. We're implementing [Y] to prevent it. I don't 
        think it'll escalate, but wanted you to know in case someone asks you about it."
    
    solutions_not_just_problems:
      
      bad: "The detection platform is broken and everything is terrible."
      
      good: |
        "The detection platform has 30% failure rate which is blocking our sprint goals. 
        I've identified three options: (A) dedicate Sarah full-time for 2 weeks to fix it, 
        (B) reduce scope and ship with known limitations, (C) delay sprint by 1 week. 
        I recommend A because [reasoning]. What do you think?"
      
      structure:
        problem: "Clear problem statement with impact"
        options: "2-3 options with pros/cons"
        recommendation: "Your recommended path forward with reasoning"
        ask: "What they need to decide or support"
      
      why_this_works: "Managers are decision-fatigued. Giving them options with recommendation makes their job easier."
    
    asking_for_what_you_need:
      
      be_direct_and_specific:
        vague: "I need more resources"
        specific: "I need one additional L4 detection engineer to hit our Q2 goal of 80% MITRE coverage. Current team is maxed out."
      
      explain_the_why:
        - "Why do you need this?"
        - "What happens if you don't get it?"
        - "What's the business impact?"
      
      make_it_easy_to_say_yes:
        - "Provide data and justification"
        - "Show you've thought through alternatives"
        - "Align request with their priorities"
      
      example: |
        "I'd like to send Alice to Black Hat conference ($3K budget). Here's why:
        - She's been researching detection evasion techniques and Black Hat has the best content
        - She'll bring back knowledge and present to team (ROI for whole team)
        - We have $5K left in learning budget for the year
        - This aligns with your goal of keeping team's skills cutting-edge
        Can we approve this?"
    
    weekly_written_updates:
      
      why: "Keeps manager informed without scheduling meetings. Creates paper trail of your work."

        template: |
          Week of [date]
          
          **Wins**
          - Shipped 5 detections for cloud misconfigurations (goal was 3)
          - Reduced FP rate from 8% to 5% through tuning
          
          **In Progress**
          - Detection platform automation (60% done, on track for end of month)
          - Hiring: interviewed 3 candidates, 1 moving to final round
          
          **Blockers / Needs**
          - Waiting on security team to approve SIEM query access (blocked for 1 week)
          - Need your help prioritizing Q2: detection coverage vs platform work?
          
          **FYI / Risks**
          - Bob mentioned he's interviewing elsewhere. Not urgent but wanted you aware.
          - Cloud provider changing API next month, might affect 10 detections

        - "No agenda at all ('nothing to discuss')"

          grew team from 5 to 10, improved retention from 60% to 90%)
        - I've demonstrated all the senior manager competencies: [list with examples]

        Alternatives considered:
        - Reduce quality (unacceptable - increases FP rate)
        - Delay timeline (impacts company compliance goals)

  # Key Takeaways

  key_takeaways:
    - "Managing up is not politics - it's making your manager successful by giving them what they need"
    - "Understand their priorities, communication style, constraints, and blind spots - adapt to work with them effectively"
    - "No surprises rule: proactively share anything that could escalate to their level, share bad news early"
    - "Bring solutions not just problems: problem statement, 2-3 options with pros/cons, your recommendation"
    - "Weekly written updates: wins, in progress, blockers/needs, FYI/risks - keeps them informed efficiently"
    - "Build trust through reliability, transparency, discretion, follow-through - do what you say you'll do"
    - "Ask for what you need directly with data: promotions, resources, budget, feedback - make it easy to say yes"
    - "Disagree privately, support publicly - make your case then commit to their decision"
    - "Different manager types need different approaches: hands-off, micromanager, conflict-avoider, absentee, brilliant jerk"
    - "Don't surprise them, go around them, complain without solutions, make them referee your conflicts, or badmouth them"
