# SECTION 29: BUILDING YOUR PERSONAL BRAND
# ============================================================================

building_personal_brand:
  
  philosophy: |
    Your personal brand is your professional reputation - what people think of when 
    they hear your name. In security, reputation matters enormously. Strong personal 
    brand opens doors: job opportunities find you, people want to work with you, your 
    opinions carry weight, you get invited to speak and advise.
    
    Personal branding isn't about self-promotion or ego. It's about: being known for 
    something specific, sharing knowledge generously, building credibility through 
    consistent quality work, and creating value for community. Done authentically, 
    it accelerates your career. Done poorly, it's transparent self-promotion that 
    backfires.
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Why Personal Brand Matters
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  why_it_matters:
    
    career_opportunities:
      
      inbound_recruiting:
        without_brand: "You apply to jobs, compete with hundreds of applicants"
        with_brand: "Recruiters reach out to you, hiring managers want to meet you"
        
        example: |
          Strong brand in detection engineering → Recruiters from top companies reach 
          out monthly with opportunities → You choose from offers instead of hoping 
          for callbacks
      
      internal_mobility:
        without_brand: "Leadership doesn't know your work or capabilities"
        with_brand: "When interesting project or promotion comes up, you're top of mind"
        
        example: "CISO needs someone to lead new security initiative → thinks of you first because of your reputation"
    
    influence_and_impact:
      
      your_ideas_matter:
        without_brand: "Propose something, met with skepticism or ignored"
        with_brand: "Propose something, people listen because you've built credibility"
      
      broader_reach:
        without_brand: "Impact limited to your team and company"
        with_brand: "Impact extends to industry through talks, writing, open source"
    
    learning_and_growth:
      
      network_effects:
        without_brand: "Learn from your immediate team"
        with_brand: "Learn from network of peers at other companies, experts reach out to you"
      
      access:
        - "Conference speaking opportunities (free attendance + visibility)"
        - "Beta access to new tools and technologies"
        - "Invitations to working groups and standards bodies"
        - "Consulting or advisory opportunities"
    
    job_security:
      
      marketability:
        - "If you're laid off, strong brand means you find new role quickly"
        - "Options and leverage in negotiations"
        - "Insurance against economic downturns"
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Defining Your Brand
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  defining_your_brand:
    
    be_known_for_something_specific:
      
      too_broad:
        bad: "I'm a security expert"
        why: "Everyone says this. Not differentiated."
      
      specific_and_differentiated:
        good: "I'm an expert in detection-as-code and automated security testing"
        why: "Specific, memorable, positions you as go-to person for this area"
        
        examples_of_niches:
          - "Cloud security for Kubernetes"
          - "Detection engineering for financial services"
          - "Security automation and SOAR"
          - "Threat hunting methodologies"
          - "Security data engineering"
          - "Application security for microservices"
      
      how_to_choose_your_niche:
        
        intersection_of:
          expertise: "What are you actually good at?"
          passion: "What do you enjoy working on and could talk about for hours?"
          demand: "What does industry need and value?"
        
        sweet_spot: "Where all three overlap"
        
        example: |
          You're good at Python automation, passionate about detection engineering, 
          industry needs detection automation → Your niche: Detection-as-code and 
          automated testing for security detections
    
    your_professional_narrative:
      
      what_is_it: "Your story - how you got here, what you care about, where you're going"
      
      components:
        background: "Brief origin story (how you got into security)"
        expertise: "What you're known for now"
        values: "What matters to you professionally"
        direction: "Where you're headed"
      
      example_narrative: |
        "I'm a detection engineering leader with 10 years in security. Started as SOC 
        analyst, frustrated by high false positive rates and slow detection deployment. 
        Spent last 5 years building detection-as-code platforms that make teams 10x 
        more productive.
        
        I'm passionate about applying software engineering practices to security - 
        CI/CD, testing, version control. I believe most security teams waste time on 
        manual processes that should be automated.
        
        Currently managing detection team at [company], building world-class detection 
        capabilities. Goal is to make detection engineering as mature as software 
        engineering."

  common_mistakes:
    
    inconsistent_effort:
      problem: "Post every day for 2 weeks, then disappear for 6 months"
      
      result: "No sustained audience building, algorithmic penalties on social platforms"
      
      fix: "Consistency beats intensity. Monthly posts sustained > daily posts for 2 weeks then nothing"
    
    self_promotion_without_value:
      problem: "Every post is 'Look at me, I'm amazing'"
      
      result: "People tune out, seen as narcissist"
      
      fix: "80/20 rule - 80% valuable content (teaching, sharing), 20% self-promotion (your talks, projects)"
    
    controversial_for_engagement:
      problem: "Hot takes and flame wars to get attention"
      
      result: "Short-term engagement, long-term reputation damage"
      
      fix: "Thoughtful, nuanced takes. Disagree without being disagreeable."
    
    neglecting_internal_reputation:
      problem: "Focus on external brand, but team thinks you're not good"
      
      result: "External brand built on false foundation, will collapse when truth emerges"
      
      fix: "Internal excellence first, external visibility second"
    
    building_brand_on_company_time:
      problem: "Spending work hours on personal blog, speaking prep, social media"
      
      result: "Conflict of interest, seen as not committed to job"
      
      fix: "Personal brand work on personal time. Exception: if it directly benefits company (company blog, speaking as company representative)"
