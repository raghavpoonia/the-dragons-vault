# SECTION 01: HIRE FOR TRAJECTORY NOT RESUME
# ============================================================================

hire_for_trajectory_not_resume:
  
  core_philosophy:
    concept: |
      The biggest mistake new managers make is hiring for what someone has done 
      rather than what they can become. A candidate with a perfect resume who has 
      stopped learning is less valuable than a hungry engineer with gaps in their 
      experience but insatiable curiosity.
      
      You're not hiring for today - you're hiring for three years from now when 
      this person has grown into a force multiplier on your team.
    
    why_this_matters: |
      Your best hires will be people who grow 3-4 levels during their time with you. 
      The person who's already "perfect" has nowhere to go. The person with high 
      trajectory will become your future senior engineer, tech lead, or manager.

  # What to Look For
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  evaluation_criteria:
    
    learning_velocity:
      definition: "How fast do they pick up new concepts? Do they synthesize information or just memorize?"
      
      how_to_evaluate:
        - "Ask: 'Tell me about something complex you learned recently' - can they explain it clearly?"
        - "Give them a new concept during interview - do they grasp it quickly?"
        - "Look at career progression - are they taking on increasingly challenging work?"
        - "Check side projects, blog, GitHub - are they learning outside work?"
      
      strong_signal:
        example: |
          Candidate taught themselves Rust in 6 months and built an open-source 
          detection tool used by 50+ security teams. When asked about learning process: 
          "I started with small experiments, read the Rust book, contributed to existing 
          projects to learn idioms, then built something real to solidify understanding."
        
        why_strong: "Self-directed learning, completed non-trivial project, shared with community, can articulate methodology"
      
      weak_signal:
        example: |
          Candidate used same tech stack for 5 years. When asked what they learned 
          recently: "I've gotten really good at Splunk." No new languages, no new 
          security domains, no expanding beyond comfort zone.
        
        why_weak: "Not challenging themselves, comfortable but stagnant, will be same person in 3 years"
    
    self_awareness:
      definition: "Do they know what they don't know? Can they admit mistakes without defensiveness?"
      
      how_to_evaluate:
        - "Ask: 'What area do you need to grow in?' - specific answer or vague?"
        - "Ask: 'Tell me about a significant mistake' - own it or blame others?"
        - "Ask: 'What feedback was hard to hear?' - acknowledge or dismiss?"
      
      strong_signal:
        example: |
          "I'm strong at detection logic but my Python skills are just functional, not 
          elegant. I can make things work but code isn't maintainable at scale. I want 
          to learn better software engineering practices - clean architecture, testing 
          patterns. I've been reading 'Clean Code' and trying to apply it."
        
        why_strong: "Specific about strengths AND gaps, has action plan, separates what they know from what they don't"
      
      weak_signal:
        example: "I don't really have any weaknesses. I'm pretty good at everything. Maybe I work too hard sometimes?"
        
        why_weak: "Classic fake weakness. Lacks self-awareness or being dishonest. Everyone has growth areas."
    
    problem_solving_approach:
      definition: "Do they break down complex problems systematically? Ask clarifying questions before jumping to solutions?"
      
      how_to_evaluate:
        - "Give complex scenario - how do they approach it?"
        - "Do they ask about constraints, data availability, trade-offs?"
        - "Can they explain reasoning step-by-step?"
        - "Consider multiple approaches or fixate on first idea?"
      
      strong_signal:
        example: |
          Asked "How would you detect lateral movement?", candidate responds:
          
          "First, I'd understand what data sources we have - Windows Event Logs? 
          Network traffic? EDR telemetry? Each gives different visibility.
          
          Second, what's our baseline for normal authentication patterns? Lateral 
          movement is about anomalies - need to know what normal looks like.
          
          Third, what techniques are we concerned about? Pass-the-Hash, RDP, WMI, 
          PSExec - each has different artifacts.
          
          Then I'd design detections based on what we have. If we have Event ID 4624 
          with network logon type, detect authentication from unusual sources. If we 
          have EDR, catch process creation from remote systems. I'd baseline normal 
          service accounts vs user accounts.
          
          Challenge is false positives - legitimate admin activity looks similar. 
          Start with high-confidence indicators and tune based on environment."
        
        why_strong: "Systematic approach, asks about constraints first, considers multiple techniques, thinks about operational reality"
      
      weak_signal:
        example: "You just write a Sigma rule for Event ID 4624 with network logon type and look for unusual authentication."
        
        why_weak: "Jumps to single solution without context, doesn't consider data availability or tuning"
    
    technical_depth:
      definition: "Do they understand fundamentals or just memorize tool syntax? Can they explain WHY things work?"
      
      how_to_evaluate:
        - "Ask 'Why does [technique] work?' not 'How do you detect it?'"
        - "Ask them to explain trade-offs between approaches"
        - "Probe multiple levels deep - can they go from concept to implementation?"
      
      strong_signal:
        example: |
          Asked about Sigma rules, candidate explains:
          
          "Sigma is vendor-agnostic detection format - standardized way to express 
          detection logic that compiles to different SIEM languages. Benefit is 
          portability - write once, works in Splunk, Elastic, QRadar.
          
          Trade-off is you lose platform-specific features. Splunk has powerful 
          statistical commands that don't map to other platforms, so pure Sigma 
          can't use those. Hand-tuned native queries often perform better.
          
          In practice, we use Sigma for common detections that should work everywhere, 
          write native queries for complex, performance-sensitive cases. Sigma compiler 
          is helpful but you still need to understand target platform."
        
        why_strong: "Understands problem Sigma solves, articulates benefits and trade-offs, practical experience with when to use"
      
      weak_signal:
        example: "Sigma rules are YAML files that detect threats. You write detection logic and it works in any SIEM."
        
        why_weak: "Surface-level understanding, no appreciation of trade-offs, sounds like read a blog post but haven't used it"
    
    communication_skills:
      definition: "Can they explain complex topics to different audiences? Do they listen and adjust?"
      
      how_to_evaluate:
        - "Ask them to explain complex project - do they organize thoughts clearly?"
        - "Do they use jargon appropriately or inappropriately?"
        - "Do they check for understanding or just monologue?"
        - "When you interrupt with question, do they listen or wait to continue?"
      
      strong_signal:
        example: |
          Explaining detection tuning:
          
          "Think of it like spam filters for email. At first, lots of legitimate emails 
          get caught as spam - those are false positives. You teach the filter what's 
          real vs spam by marking FPs. Over time it learns and gets better.
          
          Security detections are the same. Initial version catches the attack but also 
          20 legitimate things. We investigate each alert, mark as true or false positive, 
          then adjust detection logic. Maybe exclude certain users, add contextual checks, 
          change threshold.
          
          Goal is high true positive rate with low false positive rate. Under 5% FP is 
          our target - anything higher and analysts start ignoring alerts."
        
        why_strong: "Uses analogy non-security person understands, explains clearly, provides concrete metrics"
      
      weak_signal:
        example: "We used Bayesian classifier with feature engineering on n-gram distributions to achieve 0.94 AUC-ROC for binary classification in FP reduction pipeline."
        
        why_weak: "Unnecessary jargon, doesn't adjust for audience, trying to impress rather than communicate"
    
    ownership_mindset:
      definition: "Do they take responsibility for outcomes or blame external factors? Driver or passenger?"
      
      how_to_evaluate:
        - "Ask about failed project - what's their narrative?"
        - "Ask about challenges - focus on what they could or couldn't control?"
        - "Listen for language patterns - 'I did', 'we did', 'they did'"
      
      strong_signal:
        example: |
          "Our detection platform launch failed - we built it but nobody used it. In 
          hindsight, I made a critical mistake: I was so focused on building the perfect 
          technical solution that I didn't get buy-in from the SOC team early enough. 
          They had existing workflows and we were asking them to change without proving 
          value first.
          
          What I learned: involve users from day one. Show prototypes, get feedback early 
          and often, prove value incrementally. Now when I build something, I find 2-3 
          early adopters and make sure it solves their real problems before scaling."
        
        why_strong: "Takes personal responsibility, identifies specific lesson, changed behavior, focuses on what they could control"
      
      weak_signal:
        example: "Project failed because management kept changing requirements and other team didn't deliver their APIs on time. Also didn't have enough resources."
        
        why_weak: "Blames everyone else, no self-reflection on what they could have done differently, victim mentality"
    
    passion_for_security:
      definition: "Are they genuinely excited about security or just chasing a paycheck?"
      
      how_to_evaluate:
        - "What security blogs, researchers, news sources do they follow?"
        - "Do they have security-related side projects or open-source contributions?"
        - "Do they participate in security community (conferences, CTFs, Twitter)?"
        - "Why did they get into security? Origin story reveals motivation."
      
      strong_signal:
        example: |
          "I got into security after my university got hit by ransomware. I was fascinated 
          by how attackers operated - they moved laterally, escalated privileges, exfiltrated 
          data before encrypting. I started reading everything about attack techniques.
          
          I discovered MITRE ATT&CK and it was like a roadmap. Started doing CTFs on weekends 
          to understand offensive techniques. Built home lab to practice. Contributed detections 
          to open-source projects.
          
          What I love about security is the adversarial nature - it's constantly evolving. 
          You can't just learn something once and be done. Attackers adapt, you adapt back. 
          It's intellectually challenging in a way other domains aren't."
        
        why_strong: "Clear origin story driven by curiosity, ongoing learning outside work, community participation, articulates what excites them"
      
      weak_signal:
        example: "Security seems like a good career move. The pay is good and it's a growing field."
        
        why_weak: "Mercenary mindset - will leave for slightly better pay, not intrinsically motivated, won't put in extra effort"

    the_know_it_all:
      behavior: "Claims expertise in everything, gets defensive when challenged, dismisses others' perspectives"
      
      interview_signs:
        - "Actually, the way you're thinking about that is wrong..."
        - "Interrupts your questions to 'correct' your assumptions"
        - "Cannot name a single thing they don't know or person they've learned from"
      
      why_dangerous: "Won't learn from others, won't accept feedback, creates toxic team dynamics"
      
      team_impact: "Team members stop sharing ideas because know-it-all shoots them down. Knowledge sharing stops. Innovation dies."
    
    the_tool_focused_thinker:
      behavior: "Can list 20 security tools but struggles with fundamental concepts"
      
      interview_signs:
        - "How would you detect [attack]? → Use [commercial tool]"
        - "Can't explain how tool works under the hood"
        - "Stumped when asked 'What if you don't have that tool?'"
      
      why_dangerous: "When tool doesn't work or isn't available, they're helpless. Can't troubleshoot, can't build custom solutions."
      
      team_impact: "Perpetual junior contributor even after years. Can't grow into senior roles requiring deep understanding."
    
    the_external_blamer:
      behavior: "Every failure was someone else's fault or bad luck"
      
      interview_signs:
        - "Had 5 jobs in 3 years because every company had terrible management"
        - "Every project failure story blames others - other teams, management, lack of resources"
        - "No examples of learning from their own mistakes"
      
      why_dangerous: "Won't take ownership, will poison team culture with negativity, won't improve"
      
      team_impact: "Culture of blame spreads. Team morale drops. Finger-pointing instead of problem-solving."
    
    the_non_curious:
      behavior: "Doesn't ask questions during interview. No interest in role, team, or problems beyond surface."
      
      interview_signs:
        - "At end of interview: 'No, I don't have any questions for you'"
        - "Hasn't looked at your company, doesn't know what you do"
        - "Can't articulate why they want this specific role"
      
      why_dangerous: "Not interested in work, just needs a job. Won't seek help when stuck."
      
      team_impact: "Makes preventable mistakes because won't ask for help. Low engagement. Likely to leave quickly."
    
    the_title_chaser:
      behavior: "Only cares about next promotion, not about actual work or impact"
      
      interview_signs:
        - "First questions: 'What's path to senior/staff/principal? How fast can people get promoted?'"
        - "Talks more about titles than technical work"
        - "Asks about promotion criteria before understanding role"
      
      why_dangerous: "Will optimize for promotion metrics instead of team success. Won't help others."
      
      team_impact: "Politics over substance. Collaboration suffers because everyone optimizing for individual advancement."
    
    the_poor_communicator:
      behavior: "Cannot explain their work clearly. Answers rambling, full of jargon, no structure."
      
      interview_signs:
        - "Answers are 10 minutes long with no clear point"
        - "Uses maximum jargon even when simpler terms would work"
        - "Can't adjust explanation when you look confused"
      
      why_dangerous: "Can't work with other teams. Can't present to leadership. Can't document work."
      
      team_impact: "Becomes siloed. Limits their impact and team's visibility. Poor documentation makes it hard for others to build on work."

  comparison_example:
    scenario: "Hiring for mid-level Detection Engineer (L4) position"
    
    candidate_a_perfect_resume:
      background:
        years_experience: 10
        companies: "Google, Facebook, Uber"
        achievements: "Built 5 detection systems, speaks at conferences, resume looks incredible"
      
      interview_performance:
        technical: "Answers all questions correctly and confidently"
        depth: "Strong knowledge of detection tools and frameworks"
        breadth: "Has worked with many technologies"
        presentation: "Polished style, clearly done this before"
      
      red_flags_observed:
        learning_velocity: "When asked what they learned recently: 'I've been refining what I already know. Pretty much figured out detection engineering at this point.'"
        curiosity: "Didn't ask a single question about our environment, challenges, team structure"
        problem_solving: "Every answer was 'At Facebook we did it this way...' No adaptation to our context"
        self_awareness: "When asked about growth areas: 'I'm pretty much at expert level. Maybe I could learn management but focused on IC work.'"
        attitude: "Slightly dismissive of our current approach. 'Yeah, we solved that problem 5 years ago at Google.'"
      
      decision: "NO HIRE"
      
      reasoning: |
        Perfect resume but zero learning velocity. This person plateaued 2-3 years ago 
        and is now coasting on credentials. They'll be expensive ($200K+), hard to give 
        feedback to (they think they know everything), and won't grow. In 2 years they'll 
        still be doing the same thing while teammates who started behind them surpass them.
        
        The brand names on resume are impressive but this person stopped learning when 
        they got comfortable. Will bring bad attitude - "at my last company we did it 
        better" without recognizing our different constraints.
        
        Hard pass. Better to hire someone still learning than someone who's stopped.
    
    candidate_b_hungry_learner:
      background:
        years_experience: 4
        companies: "Two smaller companies (Series B startup, mid-size company)"
        achievements: "Built 1 detection system, maintains small open-source detection tool, resume good but not spectacular"
      
      interview_performance:
        technical: "Answers most questions correctly, admits when doesn't know something"
        depth: "Solid fundamental knowledge, can explain reasoning"
        breadth: "Some gaps but connects new concepts to known ones quickly"
        presentation: "Clear and humble communication, adjusts based on feedback"
      
      positive_signals:
        learning_velocity: "Taught myself Rust last year because I wanted faster detection tooling. It was hard but now I love it. I read security research papers most weekends."
        curiosity: "Asked 10+ thoughtful questions: How do you balance coverage vs FP rate? What's your detection-as-code philosophy? What challenges are you hoping this role solves?"
        problem_solving: "When given scenario they hadn't seen, broke it down systematically, asked clarifying questions, arrived at reasonable solution"
        self_awareness: "I'm strong at detection logic. My software engineering skills are still developing - I can make things work but code isn't as maintainable as I'd like."
        attitude: "Humble and excited. 'I'd love to learn from your senior engineers. The scale you operate at is exactly the challenge I'm looking for.'"
      
      decision: "STRONG HIRE at L4"
      
      reasoning: |
        High trajectory candidate. Current skills slightly below ideal but learning velocity 
        is exceptional. They'll be senior engineer (L5) within 18 months based on growth rate.
        
        The self-awareness and hunger to learn are rare and valuable. These are the people 
        who become force multipliers on your team. The open-source contribution shows they 
        code outside work hours because they enjoy it - that passion is hard to find.
        
        The humility means they'll accept feedback and grow quickly. The curiosity means 
        they'll proactively solve problems instead of waiting for direction.
        
        Easy hire. Give me 5 of these over 5 "perfect resume" candidates any day.

    - "Learning velocity is the #1 predictor of future success"
    - "Self-awareness separates people who grow from people who plateau"
    - "Problem-solving approach matters more than knowing specific tools"
    - "Passionate curiosity about security can't be taught - hire for it"
    - "One know-it-all can poison an entire team - avoid at all costs"
    - "The hungry learner at L4 becomes your senior engineer at L5 within 18 months"
    - "The 'perfect' candidate who's stopped learning stays at same level for years"
