# SECTION 23: DEALING WITH UNDERPERFORMANCE
# ============================================================================

dealing_with_underperformance:
  
  philosophy: |
    Underperformance is inevitable - not everyone works out. Addressing it is one of 
    the hardest parts of management. Most managers wait too long, hoping the problem 
    fixes itself. It never does. Avoiding the conversation hurts the underperformer 
    (they don't improve), the team (carries extra weight), and you (anxiety and guilt).
    
    Good performance management: catch issues early, give clear feedback, provide support 
    to improve, document everything, make tough calls when needed. Bad performance 
    management: ignore it, hope it goes away, surprise people at review time, drag it 
    out for years making everyone miserable.

  # Recognizing Underperformance
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  recognizing_underperformance:
    
    what_is_underperformance:
      definition: "Consistently not meeting expectations for their role and level"
      
      not_underperformance:
        - "One mistake or bad project (everyone has those)"
        - "Slower than someone more senior (unfair comparison)"
        - "Different working style than you prefer (preference, not performance)"
        - "Going through temporary personal crisis (compassion required, not PIP)"
      
      is_underperformance:
        - "Pattern over 2-3 months of not meeting expectations"
        - "Missing deadlines consistently without communication"
        - "Quality issues requiring frequent rework"
        - "Not responding to feedback or coaching"
        - "Causing problems for team or other stakeholders"
    
    types_of_underperformance:
      
      technical_underperformance:
        signs:
          - "Work has bugs or quality issues consistently"
          - "Takes much longer than expected for level"
          - "Can't work independently at level expected"
          - "Doesn't learn from feedback on technical work"
        
        example: |
          L4 engineer who should work independently still needs hand-holding on every task.
          Their code requires extensive rework by others. After 6 months, showing no improvement.
      
      communication_underperformance:
        signs:
          - "Doesn't communicate blockers until too late"
          - "Surprises stakeholders with delays or problems"
          - "Creates confusion or misunderstandings regularly"
          - "Can't explain work to others effectively"
        
        example: |
          Engineer goes silent for weeks, then announces project is delayed by month with 
          no prior warning. Does this repeatedly despite feedback.
      
      collaboration_underperformance:
        signs:
          - "Doesn't work well with others - conflicts, friction, complaints"
          - "Dismissive of others' ideas or feedback"
          - "Doesn't help others or participate in team activities"
          - "Creates toxic dynamic"
        
        example: |
          Engineer is condescending in code reviews, dismisses others' approaches, 
          multiple team members uncomfortable working with them.
      
      reliability_underperformance:
        signs:
          - "Misses deadlines without explanation"
          - "Doesn't follow through on commitments"
          - "Work sits incomplete for long periods"
          - "Frequently unavailable or unresponsive"
        
        example: |
          Engineer commits to delivering detection by end of sprint, sprint ends, 
          detection 50% done, no communication about why. Happens multiple sprints.
    
    your_gut_is_usually_right:
      
      if_you_think_theres_a_problem: "There probably is"
      
      dont_ignore_your_instinct:
        - "You notice something is off"
        - "Other team members complain or avoid working with them"
        - "You're making excuses for them: 'They're trying their best...'"
        - "You're anxious about assigning them work"
      
      act_early: "Address it at first signs, don't wait until it's catastrophic"

  # Root Cause Analysis
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  root_cause_analysis:
    
    before_assuming_its_them:
      question: "Is this actually underperformance or is it something else?"
      
      possible_other_causes:
        
        wrong_role_or_level:
          - "Hired for L4 but actually L3 skills - not underperforming, misleveled"
          - "Detection engineer but passionate about IR - wrong fit, not bad engineer"
          
          solution: "Level adjustment or role change, not performance management"
        
        unclear_expectations:
          - "You never clearly explained what good looks like"
          - "They think they're meeting expectations because you haven't said otherwise"
          
          solution: "Clarify expectations explicitly, then evaluate performance"
        
        lack_of_support_or_resources:
          - "Blocked by dependencies you haven't unblocked"
          - "Missing tools or access they need"
          - "No training or mentorship on new technology"
          
          solution: "Provide resources and support, then evaluate"
        
        personal_crisis:
          - "Going through divorce, family illness, mental health crisis"
          - "Temporary drop in performance, not fundamental capability issue"
          
          solution: "Compassion, temporary accommodation, not PIP"
        
        manager_problem:
          - "You're micromanaging and preventing them from succeeding"
          - "You're not giving clear direction or feedback"
          - "You have unrealistic expectations"
          
          solution: "Fix your management, not blame them"
    
    having_the_diagnostic_conversation:
      
      approach: "Curious and supportive, not accusatory"
      
      questions_to_ask:
        - "I've noticed [specific observations]. What's your perspective on this?"
        - "What's making this challenging for you?"
        - "Do you feel you have what you need to be successful?"
        - "Is there something going on I should know about?"
        - "How can I better support you?"
      
      listen_carefully:
        - "They might reveal blockers you didn't know about"
        - "They might be struggling with something you can help with"
        - "They might not realize there's a problem"
      
      example_conversation: |
        "I want to talk about the last three sprints. You committed to delivering 
        5 detections per sprint but delivered 2, 1, and 3. The detections that shipped 
        had quality issues that required rework. This isn't the performance I expect 
        for your level.
        
        Help me understand - what's going on? Are you blocked on something? Is the 
        work not clear? Are there issues I'm not seeing?"
        
        [Listen to their response]
        
        "Okay, I hear that [summarize their explanation]. Here's what I need to see 
        going forward: [clear expectations]. What support do you need from me to 
        make that happen?"

  # The Feedback Conversation
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  feedback_conversation:
    
    preparation:
      
      document_specific_examples:
        - "Don't rely on memory - write down specific instances"
        - "Dates, projects, outcomes"
        - "Patterns, not isolated incidents"
        
        example: |
          - Sprint 47 (Oct 1-14): Committed to 5 detections, delivered 2
          - Sprint 48 (Oct 15-28): Committed to 5, delivered 1, had 8 bugs
          - Sprint 49 (Oct 29-Nov 11): Committed to 5, delivered 3, detection 
            for lateral movement had 15% FP rate (target is <5%)
      
      involve_hr_if_serious:
        when: "If this might lead to PIP or termination"
        why: "HR ensures you follow process correctly, protects company legally"
        how: "Brief HR before conversation, have them available for questions"
      
      choose_right_time_and_place:
        when: "Early in week, early in day (not Friday at 5 PM)"
        where: "Private video call or room, won't be interrupted"
        duration: "Block 60 minutes (may not need all but have time)"
    
    the_conversation:
      
      be_direct_not_vague:
        bad: "I think you could improve your performance a bit"
        good: "Your performance is below expectations for your level and needs to improve significantly"
      
      structure:
        
        state_the_issue_clearly:
          - "Use specific examples, not generalizations"
          - "Focus on behavior and outcomes, not character"
          - "Be factual and unemotional"
          
          example: |
            "I need to talk about your performance. Over the last three months, you've 
            consistently missed sprint commitments and the work you've delivered has 
            quality issues. Specific examples: [list them]. This is not meeting expectations 
            for an L4 detection engineer."
        
        explain_impact:
          - "Why does this matter?"
          - "How does it affect team, projects, stakeholders?"
          
          example: |
            "When you miss commitments, we can't hit our team goals. When your detections 
            have quality issues, SOC loses trust in our work and other engineers have to 
            spend time fixing them. This affects the whole team."
        
        set_clear_expectations:
          - "What specifically needs to change?"
          - "What does good performance look like?"
          - "By when do you need to see improvement?"
          
          example: |
            "Here's what I need to see over the next 60 days:
            - Deliver 80% of sprint commitments on time
            - Detections have <5% false positive rate
            - Code quality improves - no more than 2 bugs per detection
            - Proactive communication if you're blocked or delayed
            
            If I don't see sustained improvement, we'll need to discuss whether this 
            role is the right fit."
        
        offer_support:
          - "What can I do to help?"
          - "What resources do you need?"
          - "Who can mentor or pair with you?"
          
          example: |
            "I want you to succeed. Here's how I'll support you:
            - Weekly 1-on-1s to discuss progress and blockers
            - Sarah will pair with you on detection quality
            - You can attend the detection engineering training next month
            
            What else would help you improve?"
        
        listen_to_their_response:
          - "Give them space to respond"
          - "They might be surprised, defensive, or upset"
          - "Acknowledge their feelings but hold firm on expectations"
          - "Don't negotiate away the expectations"
      
      document_the_conversation:
        immediately_after:
          - "Write detailed notes: what you said, what they said, agreements made"

  performance_improvement_plan:
    
    what_is_pip:
      definition: "Formal documented process with specific goals, timeline, and consequences"
      
      when_to_use:
        - "After informal feedback hasn't resulted in improvement"
        - "Performance issues are serious and documented"
        - "You're considering termination if no improvement"
      
      typical_duration: "30-90 days (60 days most common)"
      
      important: "Work with HR to create and execute PIP - don't do this alone"
    
    pip_components:
      
      specific_measurable_goals:
        - "Clear success criteria"
        - "Objectively measurable"
        - "Achievable but require real improvement"
        
        example: |
          Goal 1: Deliver 4 out of 5 sprint commitments on time
          Measured by: Sprint reports, delivery dates
          
          Goal 2: Detection quality - <5% false positive rate
          Measured by: FP metrics, SOC feedback
          
          Goal 3: Code quality - max 2 bugs per detection in production
          Measured by: Bug reports, incident tickets
      
      timeline_and_checkpoints:
        - "Overall PIP duration (e.g., 60 days)"
        - "Weekly check-ins to review progress"
        - "Mid-point review (30 days)"
        - "Final review (60 days)"
      
      support_and_resources:
        - "What you're providing to help them succeed"
        - "Mentorship, training, tools, etc."
        
        example: |
          Support provided:
          - Weekly 1-on-1s with manager for feedback and coaching
          - Pairing sessions with Sarah (senior detection engineer)
          - Access to detection engineering course
          - Clear templates and examples for quality standards
      
      consequences:
        - "Be explicit about what happens if goals not met"
        - "Usually: role change or termination"
        
        example: |
          If goals are not met by end of 60-day period, we will discuss role change 
          or employment termination.

          Week 1 PIP Check-in Summary:
          
          Goal 1 (Sprint commitments): On track - delivered 2/2 tasks this week
          Goal 2 (FP rate): Needs improvement - detection deployed had 8% FP
          Goal 3 (Code quality): Good - no bugs this week
          
          Feedback: Good progress on reliability. Need to focus on testing to 
          reduce false positives. Let's review your testing process in next 1-on-1.
      
      mid_point_review:
        - "Formal review at 30 days"

        options:
          - "Extend PIP another 30-60 days with adjusted goals"
          - "Move to different role with lower expectations"

          - "Person knows they're being pushed out"
          - "Hard to recover trust and performance"
          - "They often start job searching immediately"
      
      pip_is_still_necessary:
        why:
          - "Legal protection - documented process if termination leads to lawsuit"
          - "Fairness - gives person clear chance to improve"
          - "Occasionally people do turn it around"
          - "Company policy may require it before termination"
      
      be_honest_with_yourself:
        - "If you've truly lost confidence they can succeed, PIP is formality"
        - "Don't drag it out - be clear about reality"
        - "Humane termination often better than painful PIP that ends in termination anyway"

  # Common Mistakes
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  common_mistakes:
    
    waiting_too_long:
      problem: "Hoping problem fixes itself, giving 'one more chance' repeatedly"
      
      cost:
        - "Underperformer doesn't improve (no clear feedback)"
        - "Team carries extra weight and resents you"
        - "Your credibility as manager suffers"
        - "Eventually have to fire them anyway, but after more pain"
      
      fix: "Address issues within 1-2 months of noticing pattern"
    
    surprise_termination:
      problem: "Person has no idea they're underperforming until fired"
      
      why_this_happens: "Manager avoids difficult conversations, only gives positive feedback"
      
      cost:
        - "Legal risk (wrongful termination)"
        - "Cruel to employee"
        - "Team loses trust in you"
      
      fix: "Continuous feedback, clear conversations when problems arise, documented PIP if serious"
    
    being_too_nice:
      problem: "Sugarcoating feedback, avoiding hard truths, making excuses for them"
      
      example: "They're trying really hard, they've had a tough year, I'm sure they'll improve..."
      
      result: "They don't improve because they don't know there's a problem. You're helping no one."
      
      fix: "Radical candor - be direct because you care about them and team"
    
    keeping_someone_too_long_out_of_guilt:
      problem: "Feel bad about firing them, so let it drag on"
      
      why_this_is_bad:
        - "False hope for them (they think they're fine)"
        - "Unfair to team who carries weight"
        - "Prevents them from finding better-fit job"
        - "Wastes their time and yours"
      
      reframe: "Kindest thing is helping them move on to better fit, not keeping them in wrong role"
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "Underperformance is pattern over 2-3 months, not one mistake - consistently not meeting expectations"
    - "Types: technical, communication, collaboration, reliability - be specific about what's not working"
    - "Root cause first: wrong role/level, unclear expectations, lack of support, personal crisis, manager problem - fix these if applicable"
    - "Feedback conversation: specific examples, explain impact, clear expectations, offer support, document everything"
    - "PIP: formal 30-90 day process with measurable goals, weekly check-ins, consequences - work with HR"
    - "PIP reality: 50-70% end in termination, but necessary for legal protection and fairness"
    - "Termination: involve HR always, brief and direct meeting (15-30 min), tell team same day"
    - "Common mistakes: waiting too long (address in 1-2 months), surprise termination (continuous feedback required), being too nice (sugarcoating helps no one)"
    - "Keeping someone too long out of guilt is unfair to them, team, and you - kindest thing is helping them move to better fit"
    - "Address issues early with clear feedback - most problems never reach PIP if handled promptly"
