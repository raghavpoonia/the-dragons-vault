# SECTION 31: AVOIDING BURNOUT

avoiding_burnout:
  
  philosophy: |
    Security management is high-stress: constant incidents, never-ending work, impossible 
    expectations, always being the "no" person. Burnout is epidemic in security. I've 
    seen brilliant managers burn out and leave the field entirely - loss for them and 
    industry.
    
    Burnout isn't weakness. It's predictable outcome of sustained overwork, lack of 
    control, and values misalignment. You can't pour from empty cup - burned out manager 
    makes bad decisions, treats team poorly, and eventually quits. Taking care of yourself 
    isn't selfish, it's prerequisite for taking care of your team.

  # Personal Strategies for Preventing Burnout
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  personal_strategies:
    
    set_boundaries:
      
      work_hours:
        principle: "You can sprint occasionally, but can't marathon at sprint pace"
        
        sustainable: "45-50 hours per week long-term"
        
        unsustainable: "60+ hours per week (burnout in 6-12 months)"
        
        enforce_boundaries:
          - "Leave work at reasonable hour (6 PM not 9 PM)"
          - "Don't check email after hours (unless on-call)"
          - "Weekends are for recovery, not catching up"
        
        if_cant_finish_in_50_hours:
          - "You have too much work (need to delegate or drop things)"
          - "OR you're inefficient (need to improve productivity)"
          - "OR company has unrealistic expectations (need to reset or leave)"
      
      on_call:
        problem: "Always on-call creates constant anxiety, never truly off"
        
        solution:
          - "Rotate on-call (nobody on-call 24/7/365)"
          - "Clear handoff between on-call rotations"
          - "When not on-call, truly off (someone else owns it)"
          - "Comp time after rough on-call week"
      
      saying_no:
        hardest_skill: "Saying no to reasonable requests when you're at capacity"
        
        how_to_say_no:
          - "I'd love to help, but I'm at capacity. Can we prioritize this over X or delay to next quarter?"
          - "I can do this if you're okay with Y being delayed. Which is more important?"
          - "I don't have bandwidth for this. Can someone else take it?"
        
        remember: "Saying yes to everything means doing everything poorly"
    
    protect_your_energy:
      
      energy_management:
        principle: "Manage energy, not just time. Some activities drain you, others recharge."

          - "Conflict and difficult conversations"

          - "1-on-1s with engaged team members"
          - "Learning and building new things"
          - "Celebrating wins with team"
        
        strategy: "Balance draining with energizing. Don't schedule all draining activities on same day."
      
      recovery_time:
        
        daily:
          - "30-60 min of decompression after work (exercise, hobby, walk)"
          - "No work email after 7 PM"
          - "7-8 hours sleep (non-negotiable)"

      zoom_out:
        when_stressed: "Will this matter in 1 year? 5 years?"
        
        often: "Things that feel urgent now are forgotten next month"
        
        helps: "Reduce anxiety about day-to-day fires"
      
      celebrate_wins:
        problem: "Security is thankless - only notice when things go wrong"
        
        solution:
          - "Actively celebrate successes with team"

  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "Burnout is exhaustion + cynicism + inefficacy - not just tiredness, deeper systemic problem"
    - "Causes: workload (60-80 hrs/week sustained), lack of control, insufficient reward, no community, unfairness, values mismatch"
    - "Warning signs: chronic fatigue, irritability, procrastination, cynicism, questioning abilities, physical symptoms"
    - "Set boundaries: 45-50 hrs/week sustainable, rotate on-call, say no when at capacity, don't check email after hours"
    - "Protect energy: balance draining activities (meetings, conflicts) with energizing (deep work, learning), need recovery time"
    - "Recovery time needed: daily (30-60 min decompression, 7-8 hrs sleep), weekly (weekend off), quarterly (1 week vacation fully disconnected)"
    - "Maintain perspective: it's just a job, not your identity - company will replace you, no job worth your health"
    - "Physical health matters: exercise 30 min 3-4x/week (most effective stress tool), sleep 7-8 hrs (non-negotiable), eat real food"
    - "Watch for team burnout: behavioral changes, performance decline, offer support (adjust workload, time off, professional help)"
    - "If already burned out: take 1-2 weeks off minimum, talk to therapist/doctor, assess if fixable - if not, start job search"
    - "Self-assessment: score burnout checklist - 26+ is high risk requiring immediate action, 36+ severe requiring time off and help"
    - "Remember: you can't pour from empty cup - taking care of yourself is prerequisite for taking care of team"
