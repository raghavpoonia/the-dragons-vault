# SECTION 19: CRISIS MANAGEMENT
# ============================================================================

crisis_management:
  
  philosophy: |
    Crises are inevitable in security - major incidents, data breaches, critical 
    vulnerabilities, team implosions, sudden departures. How you respond defines you 
    as a leader. In crisis, people look to you for stability, direction, and confidence.
    
    Good crisis management: stay calm, gather facts, communicate clearly, make decisions 
    quickly with incomplete information, support your team, and learn from it afterward. 
    Bad crisis management: panic, blame people, make rash decisions, hide information, 
    or freeze up.

  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "Crises are inevitable - your response defines you as leader, people look to you for stability"
    - "Types: technical (incidents, outages, vulns), people (departures, conflicts), organizational (layoffs, reorgs)"
    - "Immediate response (1-24 hours): stay calm, gather facts, establish command, immediate containment, communicate upward"
    - "Stabilization (24-72 hours): assemble response team, create communication cadence, manage team workload, document everything"
    - "Resolution: fix root cause, communicate resolution, thank people publicly"
    - "Postmortem (within 1 week): blameless, what happened/why, what went well/poorly, action items with owners"
    - "Communication principles: be honest, be calm, be frequent, be clear - over-communicate during crisis"
    - "Support team: acknowledge stress, be visible, check in individually, remove obstacles, make decisions quickly"
    - "After crisis: mandatory downtime, recognize contributions, emotional debrief on how people felt"
    - "Learn from it: identify system weaknesses, team gaps, leadership lessons - build resilience through preparation and culture"
