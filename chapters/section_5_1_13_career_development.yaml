career_development:
  
  philosophy: |
    Your job as manager isn't just to get work done through your team - it's to grow 
    people. Help them develop skills, advance their careers, and reach their potential. 
    The best managers are force multipliers who develop people who surpass them.
    
    Career development is not just about promotions. It's about helping people grow, 
    learn new skills, take on bigger challenges, and figure out what they want from 
    their careers. Some want to climb the ladder. Others want to go deep technically. 
    Some want work-life balance. Your job is to help them succeed on their terms.

        Promoting Alice from L4 to L5 Detection Engineer
        
        Summary: Alice has consistently performed at L5 level for the past 9 months. 
        She led the detection-as-code platform initiative that made the entire team 
        2x more productive. She mentored two junior engineers who both got promoted. 
        She's operating as a senior engineer in all respects except title.
        
        L5 Expectations:
        - Leads large technical initiatives ✓
        - Mentors multiple engineers ✓
        - Influences beyond immediate team ✓
        - Recognized expert in domain ✓
        
        Evidence:
        1. Detection Platform (Q2-Q3): Led design and implementation of detection-as-code 
           platform. Reduced deployment time from 2 weeks to 2 days. Entire team now uses 
           it. Impact: Team productivity increased 2x, measured by detections shipped per 
           quarter (40 → 80).

  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "Career development is not just promotions - it's helping people grow on their own terms"
    - "IC and management tracks are equally valuable - staff engineer = director in seniority"
    - "IC vs management decision: trial both through mentoring, tech lead roles, see what energizes them"
    - "Growth mechanisms: stretch assignments (70% confident), mentorship, training, rotations, side projects"
    - "Stretch assignments should be 70% confident/30% stretch - if 100% confident, not growth opportunity"
    - "Career conversations quarterly: understand goals, identify gaps, create plan, provide support"
    - "Promotion requires 6-12 months sustained performance at next level, not just one good project"
    - "Build strong promotion packet: clear evidence of next-level impact, peer feedback, your advocacy"
    - "If promotion rejected: be transparent, explain why, create improvement plan, set timeline for retry"
    - "Best managers grow people who surpass them - that's success, not threat"
