# SECTION 33: COMMON LEADERSHIP ANTI-PATTERNS
# ============================================================================

  philosophy: |
    Every manager makes mistakes. The question is whether you recognize them, learn 
    from them, and change. This section catalogs common anti-patterns I've seen (and 
    made myself). Reading this list is uncomfortable - you'll recognize yourself in 
    multiple patterns. That's normal. The goal isn't perfection, it's awareness and 
    continuous improvement.
    
    Anti-patterns are seductive because they often work short-term or feel natural. 
    Micromanaging gets things done your way. Avoiding conflict feels comfortable. 
    Being the hero is satisfying. But long-term, these patterns destroy teams, limit 
    your effectiveness, and stunt your growth as leader.
