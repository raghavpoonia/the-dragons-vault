# SECTION 16: CONFLICT RESOLUTION
# ============================================================================

conflict_resolution:
  
  philosophy: |
    Conflict is inevitable when smart, passionate people work together. The question 
    isn't whether conflict will happen - it's how you handle it. Unresolved conflict 
    festers, destroys team morale, and kills productivity. Well-managed conflict leads 
    to better decisions, stronger relationships, and team growth.
    
    Your job as manager: don't avoid conflict, don't let it escalate, and don't take 
    sides prematurely. Create space for healthy disagreement while preventing toxic 
    behavior. Most conflicts resolve themselves if you facilitate honest conversation 
    between adults.
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Types of Conflict
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  types_of_conflict:
    
    task_conflict:
      definition: "Disagreement about work itself - approach, priorities, technical decisions"
      
      examples:
        - "Should we use detection-as-code or traditional SIEM rules?"
        - "Which MITRE techniques should we prioritize?"
        - "Is this detection too noisy to deploy?"
      
      healthy_or_unhealthy: "Healthy if handled well - leads to better decisions"
      
      how_to_handle: "Facilitate technical discussion with data and criteria, make decision if team can't converge"
    
    process_conflict:
      definition: "Disagreement about how team operates - workflows, meetings, processes"
      
      examples:
        - "Standup is waste of time vs standup keeps us aligned"
        - "We need more process vs we're drowning in process"
        - "Code review takes too long vs code review prevents bugs"
      
      healthy_or_unhealthy: "Healthy - surfaces process problems"
      
      how_to_handle: "Run retrospective, try experiments, measure outcomes"
    
    relationship_conflict:
      definition: "Personal tension between people - personality clashes, resentment, mistrust"
      
      examples:
        - "Alice thinks Bob is lazy. Bob thinks Alice is controlling."
        - "Sarah dismisses Tom's ideas in meetings. Tom feels disrespected."
        - "Two people who just don't get along"
      
      healthy_or_unhealthy: "Unhealthy - damages team dynamics and morale"
      
      how_to_handle: "Immediate intervention required - mediate conversation, set behavioral expectations, separate if needed"
    
    values_conflict:
      definition: "Disagreement about fundamental values or principles"
      
      examples:
        - "Move fast vs get it perfect"
        - "Individual autonomy vs team alignment"
        - "Work-life balance vs grinding for deadlines"
      
      healthy_or_unhealthy: "Can be healthy if discussing team values, unhealthy if fundamental incompatibility"
      
      how_to_handle: "Clarify team values explicitly, align people with those values, some people might not fit"

  # Stages of Conflict
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  stages_of_conflict:
    
    stage_1_discomfort:
      what: "Something feels off but not yet explicit"
      
      signs:
        - "Passive-aggressive comments in Slack"
        - "People avoiding each other"
        - "Tension in meetings but nothing said directly"
        - "Body language signals (eye rolls, crossed arms, sighs)"
      
      your_action:
        - "Notice it early - don't ignore"
        - "Check in privately: 'I sensed some tension in that meeting. What's going on?'"
        - "Create space for people to raise concerns"
      
      if_caught_here: "Easy to resolve - just bring it into the open"
    
    stage_2_incident:
      what: "Specific event where conflict becomes visible"
      
      signs:
        - "Heated argument in meeting"
        - "Someone storms out"
        - "Public criticism or dismissal"
        - "Escalation to you via email or Slack"
      
      your_action:
        - "Intervene quickly - don't let it fester"
        - "Talk to each person separately first to understand perspectives"
        - "Then facilitate conversation between them"
      
      if_caught_here: "Still resolvable but requires active intervention"
    
    stage_3_polarization:
      what: "People have taken sides, positions hardened"
      
      signs:
        - "Team split into camps"
        - "People recruiting allies"
        - "Backchanneling and gossip"
        - "Refusal to work together"
      
      your_action:
        - "Serious intervention required"
        - "May need HR involvement"
        - "Separate people if needed"
        - "Address it as team issue, not just individuals"
      
      if_caught_here: "Hard to resolve, may require team restructure or people leaving"
    
    stage_4_toxic:
      what: "Open hostility, sabotage, complete breakdown"
      
      signs:
        - "Active sabotage of each other's work"
        - "Personal attacks"
        - "Team completely dysfunctional"
        - "People threatening to quit"
      
      your_action:
        - "Immediate action required - separate people physically"
        - "Involve HR and leadership"
        - "Likely outcome: one or both people leave team or company"
      
      if_caught_here: "Usually unrecoverable - focus on limiting damage"
    
    lesson: "Catch conflicts at stage 1 or 2. By stage 3-4, it's too late for easy resolution."

        questions_to_ask:
          - "What happened from your perspective?"
          - "How did that make you feel?"
          - "What do you think the other person's perspective is?"
          - "What outcome are you hoping for?"
          - "What role did you play in this situation?"

        dig_deeper: "Keep asking 'why' to get to root cause"
        
        common_real_issues:

        where: "Private space where you won't be interrupted"
        
        setup: |
          "I've talked to both of you separately. I'd like us to talk through this 
          together and find a path forward. The goal isn't to determine who's right,

          - "How will you handle similar situations in the future?"

      your_approach:
        
        understand_criteria:
          - "What are we optimizing for? (performance, maintainability, time to ship, etc)"
          - "What are the tradeoffs of each approach?"
          - "What data or evidence supports each approach?"
        
        timebox_decision:
          - "We've discussed this for X weeks. We need to decide by Friday."
          - "Let's prototype both approaches if time permits"

        make_decision:
          - "Based on [criteria], we're going with approach B"
          - "I know some of you disagree, and that's okay"
          - "We're going to disagree and commit - we'll execute this well and reevaluate in 3 months"
        
        after_decision:
          - "Thank both people for passionate engagement"
          - "Ensure person whose approach wasn't chosen isn't resentful"
          - "Actually reevaluate in 3 months - did we make right call?"
    
    personality_clash:
      situation: "Two people just don't get along - different work styles, personalities, communication styles"
      
      examples:
        - "Alice is very direct and blunt. Bob takes things personally and feels attacked."
        - "Sarah is very detail-oriented and thorough. Tom is move-fast-and-iterate. They frustrate each other."
      
      your_approach:
        
        acknowledge_differences:
          - "You have different work styles. That's normal and can be strength if managed well."
          - "Alice, your directness gets things done quickly. Bob, your thoughtfulness catches issues early."
          - "Challenge is communicating across these differences."
        
        explicit_communication_agreements:
          - "Alice will preface critical feedback with context: 'I have concerns about X. Here's my thinking...'"

    team_member_undermining_you:
      situation: "Someone on team constantly questions your decisions, undermines your authority, complains about you"
      
      signs:
        - "Eye rolls or dismissive comments in meetings"
        - "Backchanneling - telling others they disagree with your decisions"
        - "Directly contradicting you in front of team"
        - "Going around you to your manager or skip level"
      
      your_approach:

          what_to_say: |
            "I've noticed you've disagreed with several of my decisions recently - the 
            sprint planning approach, the new process for detections, and my call on the 
            cloud security project. I'm open to disagreement and feedback, but the way 
            you're expressing it is undermining my ability to lead the team. 
            
            When you roll your eyes in meetings or tell other team members you think I'm 
            wrong, it creates division on the team. I need you to either raise concerns 
            directly with me, or disagree and commit.
            
            What's driving this? Are there specific concerns about my leadership you want 
            to discuss?"
        
        listen_to_their_perspective:
          - "Maybe they have legitimate concerns you need to hear"
          - "Maybe they're frustrated with lack of influence or autonomy"

          - "Disagreement in private is welcome and valuable"
          - "Public undermining is not acceptable"
          - "If you disagree with my decision, we discuss it, then you support it publicly"
          - "Going around me to my manager without talking to me first is not acceptable"
        
        consequences_if_continues:
          - "If this behavior continues, it becomes performance issue"
          - "Document the conversation"
          - "If behavior doesn't change, put them on PIP or manage them out"
    
    two_people_refusing_to_work_together:

      your_approach:
        
        dont_accept_this_immediately:
          - "You're both professionals. Part of being professional is working with people you might not like."

        set_minimum_standards:
          - "What's required: communicate clearly about work, respond to messages within 24 hours, treat each other professionally"
          - "What's not required: hang out socially, like each other personally"
        
        try_structured_collaboration:

  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "Conflict is inevitable - question is how you handle it, not whether it happens"
    - "Types: task (healthy), process (healthy), relationship (unhealthy), values (depends)"
    - "Stages: discomfort → incident → polarization → toxic. Catch it at stage 1-2."
    - "Resolution framework: understand both perspectives separately → facilitate conversation together → follow up"
    - "Conversation structure: ground rules, each person shares, identify common ground, explore solutions, agree on next steps"
    - "Technical disagreements: understand criteria, timebox decision, make final call, disagree and commit"
    - "Personality clashes: acknowledge differences, explicit communication agreements, structured interactions, minimize collaboration if needed"
    - "Someone undermining you: private direct conversation, listen to concerns, set clear expectations, document and escalate if continues"
    - "Prevention: establish team norms for disagreement, build trust through bonding and vulnerability, address issues early"
    - "Don't avoid conflict, don't let it fester, facilitate resolution between adults"
