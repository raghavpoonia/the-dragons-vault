  dragon_metaphor: |
    The ancient dragon does not rule through fear alone, though its power is 
    unmatched. It commands through wisdom earned across centuries, through the 
    careful cultivation of its domain, and through the strategic deployment of 
    its considerable strengths. A dragon knows when to breathe fire and when to 
    listen. It understands that true power lies not in hoarding gold, but in 
    building a stronghold that can withstand any siege.
    
    As a security leader, you are the dragon of your domain. Your team is your 
    stronghold, each member a carefully selected scale in your armor. This chapter 
    is the accumulated wisdom of security leaders who have built teams from nothing, 
    navigated organizational politics, responded to breaches at 3 AM and presented 
    to boards at 9 AM.
