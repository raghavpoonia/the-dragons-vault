# SECTION 26: MEASURING TEAM IMPACT
# ============================================================================

measuring_team_impact:
  
  philosophy: |
    "What gets measured gets managed." You need metrics to understand if your team is 
    succeeding, to make data-driven decisions, and to communicate value to leadership. 
    But wrong metrics drive wrong behavior. Measure output (detections shipped) and 
    people optimize for quantity over quality. Measure only quality and nothing ships.
    
    Good metrics: actionable, drive right behaviors, tell complete story. Bad metrics: 
    vanity metrics that look good but don't reflect real impact, metrics that drive 
    gaming or perverse incentives, measuring activity instead of outcomes.
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Principles of Good Metrics
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  principles_of_good_metrics:
    
    measure_outcomes_not_outputs:
      
      output_metrics:
        definition: "What you produced (activity)"
        examples:
          - "Number of detections shipped"
          - "Lines of code written"
          - "Tickets closed"
          - "Hours worked"
        
        problem: "Can game these without delivering value"
      
      outcome_metrics:
        definition: "Impact and value delivered (results)"
        examples:
          - "Coverage of MITRE ATT&CK techniques"
          - "Attacks detected and prevented"
          - "Mean time to detect (MTTD)"
          - "False positive rate reduction"
        
        why_better: "Measures actual value, harder to game"
      
      balance_both:
        principle: "Need both - outputs show activity, outcomes show impact"
        
        example: |
          Output: Shipped 40 detections this quarter
          Outcome: Increased ATT&CK coverage from 60% to 80%, detected 3 real attacks
    
    leading_vs_lagging_indicators:
      
      lagging_indicators:
        definition: "Measure results after the fact"
        examples:
          - "Attacks detected this quarter"
          - "Annual security incidents"
          - "Compliance audit results"
        
        limitation: "Too late to course-correct in the moment"
      
      leading_indicators:
        definition: "Predict future outcomes, can act on them now"
        examples:
          - "Detection deployment velocity (predicts future coverage)"
          - "False positive rate trend (predicts SOC effectiveness)"
          - "Technical debt accumulation (predicts future velocity)"
        
        value: "Actionable - can intervene before outcomes suffer"
      
      use_both: "Leading indicators for day-to-day management, lagging indicators for overall assessment"
    
    avoid_vanity_metrics:
      
      what_are_vanity_metrics:
        definition: "Metrics that look good but don't reflect real value"
        
        examples:
          - "Total detections (including legacy/unused ones)"
          - "100% MITRE ATT&CK coverage (but only surface-level, low-quality detections)"
          - "Zero false positives (achieved by not alerting on anything)"
        
        problem: "Create false sense of success, distract from real issues"
      
      how_to_spot_them:
        question: "If this metric improves, does it actually mean we're more secure or effective?"
        
        test: "Can metric look great while team is failing? If yes, it's vanity metric."
    
    metrics_should_drive_action:
      
      actionable_metric:
        definition: "When metric changes, you know what to do"
        
        example: |
          Metric: False positive rate increased from 3% to 8%
          Action: Review detections with highest FP rates, tune or disable
      
      non_actionable_metric:
        definition: "Interesting but unclear what to do about it"
        
        example: |
          Metric: Team morale score 6.5/10
          Unclear: What specifically should you change?
      
      make_metrics_actionable: "Every metric should have associated action when it goes out of bounds"

      result: "Team optimizes for appearing busy, not delivering value"

  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "Measure outcomes (impact) not just outputs (activity) - outcomes show real value"
    - "Leading indicators (detection velocity, FP trends) predict future, lagging indicators (attacks detected) show results - use both"
    - "Core detection metrics: MITRE coverage (target 80%+), false positive rate (<5%), true positive rate (>90% in tests), deployment time (target 2-3 days)"
    - "Core IR metrics: MTTD (<24 hrs), MTTR (<4 hrs for critical), incident trends over time"
    - "Team health metrics: sprint velocity, cycle time, bug rate, technical debt, engagement scores, attrition (<10%/year healthy)"
    - "Executive communication: one-page monthly dashboard with status/metrics/wins/concerns, quarterly business review with impact focus"
    - "Translate technical to business: 'Reduced FP rate 40%' becomes 'SOC can investigate 60% more alerts, finding real threats faster'"
    - "Common mistakes: measuring too much (focus on 5-7 key), only activity not outcomes, unrealistic targets, not acting on metrics, using punitively"
    - "Metrics should drive action - every metric should have associated response when out of bounds"
    - "Avoid vanity metrics (look good but meaningless) - test: 'Can this look great while we're failing? If yes, wrong metric'"
