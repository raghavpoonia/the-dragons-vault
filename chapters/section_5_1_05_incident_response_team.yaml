  # Hiring Priorities
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  hiring_priorities:
    
    first_hire:
      role: "Senior Incident Responder"
      rationale: "Need someone who can handle incidents independently while you build team"
      background: "SOC analyst with 3+ years, or junior responder with strong potential"
    
    second_third_hires:
      role: "Mid-level Responders"
      rationale: "Build sustainable on-call rotation (need minimum 3 people)"
      diversity: "Mix of backgrounds - one with forensics, one with malware, one with cloud"
    
    fourth_fifth_hires:
      options:
        option_1: "Threat Hunter (if want proactive capability)"
        option_2: "More responders (if incident volume high)"
      decision_criteria: "If handling >10 incidents/week, hire responders. If want to find incidents proactively, hire hunter."
    
    sixth_plus_hires:
      considerations:
        - "Add forensics specialist if complex incidents frequent"
        - "Add junior responders for career development pipeline"
        - "Consider follow-the-sun if global"
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "IR team roles: Incident Responders (L3-L6), optional Threat Hunters, optional Forensics Specialists"
    - "Three topology options: Follow-the-sun (10-15 people), On-call rotation (3-8 people), Embedded (100+ company)"
    - "Most companies should use on-call rotation - it's sustainable with proper compensation and rotation"
    - "Severity framework critical: Sev 0 (breach), Sev 1 (significant), Sev 2 (medium), Sev 3 (low)"
    - "Evolution: Reactive (1-2 people, 0-6 months) → Structured (3-5, 6-18 months) → Proactive (6-10, 18-36 months)"
    - "First hire: Senior responder who can operate independently"
    - "Need minimum 3 people for sustainable on-call rotation"
    - "Add threat hunter at 5+ people if want proactive capability"
    - "Add forensics specialist only if justified by complex incidents or regulatory requirements"
    - "On-call sustainability requires: compensation, time off after incidents, page volume limits"
