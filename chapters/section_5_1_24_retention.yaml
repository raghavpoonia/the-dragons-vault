# SECTION 24: RETENTION AND PREVENTING ATTRITION
# ============================================================================

retention_and_preventing_attrition:
  
  philosophy: |
    Losing good people is expensive and demoralizing. Recruiting, hiring, and ramping 
    someone new takes 6-12 months and costs $100K+. More importantly, when good people 
    leave, team morale drops, remaining people get overloaded, and others start looking 
    to leave too. Attrition is contagious.
    
    Your job: understand why people leave, proactively address issues before they become 
    resignation letters, create environment where people want to stay. You can't retain 
    everyone - some departures are healthy - but you should rarely be surprised by someone 
    quitting. If you're surprised, you weren't paying attention.

  key_takeaways:
    - "People leave for: compensation, career growth, bad manager, boring work, team/culture, work-life balance, life circumstances"
    - "Early warning signs: disengagement, attitude shift, decreased productivity, asking about market comp, updating LinkedIn"
    - "Have regular pulse checks in 1-on-1s and quarterly stay conversations - normalize discussing satisfaction"
    - "Direct conversation when you sense they're leaving: 'Are you thinking about leaving? What would make you stay?'"
    - "Counter-offer only if: strong performer, you can address concerns, they're conflicted, you genuinely want them to stay"
    - "Counter-offer reality: 70% who accept still leave within 12 months - relationship may be damaged"
    - "Proactive retention: career development, recognition, autonomy, interesting work, work-life balance, strong culture"
    - "Healthy attrition: 10-15% voluntary is normal, >15% is red flag, losing >30% of top performers is crisis"
    - "When someone leaves: exit interview to learn, smooth transition, tell team positively, reflect on what you could have done differently"
    - "You can't retain everyone - some departures are healthy - but you should rarely be surprised by resignation"
