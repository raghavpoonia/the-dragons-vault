# SECTION 18: STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
# ============================================================================

stakeholder_management:
  
  philosophy: |
    Your team doesn't exist in isolation. You depend on other teams for data, resources, 
    and support. Other teams depend on you for security coverage and guidance. Executives 
    care about business outcomes your work enables. Managing these relationships well 
    determines whether your team succeeds or struggles.
    
    Good stakeholder management means understanding what different stakeholders need, 
    communicating in their language, building trust through reliability, and making it 
    easy for them to work with you. Bad stakeholder management creates enemies, blocks 
    your team's work, and makes everything harder than it needs to be.

    stakeholder_mapping:
      
      primary_stakeholders:
        definition: "People/teams your work directly affects or who directly affect your work"
        
        examples_for_detection_team:
          - "SOC team (consumes your detections)"
          - "Incident response team (uses your detections during investigations)"
          - "Infrastructure/DevOps team (provides data sources)"
          - "Compliance team (relies on your coverage)"
          - "Your manager and leadership chain"
        
        engagement_level: "High - regular communication, strong relationships critical"
      
      secondary_stakeholders:
        definition: "People/teams indirectly affected or occasionally need your input"
        
        examples:
          - "Application security team"
          - "Red team"
          - "Legal team (occasionally needs security data)"
          - "Engineering teams (occasionally need security guidance)"
        
        engagement_level: "Medium - periodic check-ins, maintain relationship"
      
      tertiary_stakeholders:
        definition: "People/teams rarely interact but good to maintain awareness"
        
        examples:
          - "Executive leadership (care about outcomes, not details)"
          - "Board (only care about major incidents or compliance)"
          - "External auditors (periodic interaction)"
        
        engagement_level: "Low - communicate major updates, executive summaries only"
    
    power_interest_matrix:
      
      high_power_high_interest:
        who: "Your manager, CISO, key partner team leads"
        strategy: "Manage closely - frequent communication, involve in decisions, build strong relationship"
      
      high_power_low_interest:
        who: "Executives, senior leadership who care about outcomes but not how"
        strategy: "Keep satisfied - communicate major milestones, don't overload with details"
      
      low_power_high_interest:
        who: "Individual contributors on partner teams who work with you daily"
        strategy: "Keep informed - they care a lot, but don't have authority to block or enable"
      
      low_power_low_interest:
        who: "Teams you rarely interact with"
        strategy: "Monitor - minimal communication, but stay aware of their needs"

        format: "Slack, technical docs, architecture reviews, regular sync meetings"
        frequency: "Weekly or biweekly syncs, ad-hoc for urgent issues"
        
        example: |
          "We're seeing 30% false positives on lateral movement detections because of 
          legitimate service account behavior. We need better context on which service 
          accounts are expected to access multiple hosts. Can we integrate with your 
          service account registry? Here's the technical design..."

          **Detection: Credential Dumping via LSASS Memory**
          
          **What this detects:** Attacker attempting to extract credentials from memory
          
          **Severity:** Critical
          
          **Expected FP rate:** <2%
          
          **Investigation steps:**
          1. Verify process that accessed LSASS memory
          2. Check if process is legitimate security tool (SCCM, AV, etc)
          3. Look for suspicious parent process or command line
          4. Check for other suspicious activity on same host
          
          **Known false positives:**
          - SCCM client updates
          - Antivirus full scans
          - Legitimate admin tools
          
          **Escalation criteria:** Escalate if no legitimate explanation found

            good: "We reduced security risk by covering 80% of common attack techniques. This protects us from 95% of ransomware attacks we've seen."
          
          quantify_impact:
            - "Reduced detection deployment time from 2 weeks to 2 days (14x faster)"
            - "Caught 3 real attacks last quarter that would have cost $2M+ in damages"
            - "Achieved SOC 2 compliance coverage for detection requirements"
          
          explain_risk_in_business_terms:
            bad: "We don't have detection for Kerberoasting"
            good: "We have a gap in detecting credential theft attacks, which are used in 70% of ransomware incidents. Ransomware typically costs $5M in downtime and remediation. Closing this gap reduces our risk significantly."

        example_exec_summary: |
          **Q2 Detection Engineering - Executive Summary**
          
          **Key Outcomes:**
          - 80% coverage of MITRE ATT&CK framework (up from 60%) - significantly reduces risk
          - Detected and stopped 3 serious attacks before they caused damage (estimated $2M saved)
          - SOC alert quality improved - false positives down 40%, analyst productivity up 30%
          
          **Risk Summary:**
          - High priority gaps: cloud security monitoring (60% covered, target 90% by Q3)
          - Medium priority: insider threat detection (on roadmap for Q4)
          
          **Costs:**
          - Team of 5 engineers - $750K annually (within budget)
          - SIEM costs stable at $200K/year
          
          **Q3 Focus:** Complete cloud coverage, improve automation to scale further

  key_takeaways:
    - "Map your stakeholders: primary (high engagement), secondary (medium), tertiary (low)"
    - "Communicate in their language: technical peers want details, executives want business impact, SOC wants actionable guidance"
    - "Build relationships through regular touchpoints: monthly syncs for key partners, quarterly business reviews"
    - "Be responsive: reply within 24 hours, follow through on commitments, be proactive in offering help"
    - "Make stakeholders successful: understand their goals, help them achieve them, give them credit publicly"
    - "Difficult stakeholders: blocker (address concerns, escalate if needed), ghost (make requests specific and escalate), demander (set boundaries), critic (understand concerns or set boundaries)"
    - "Influence without authority: reciprocity (help them first), social proof (others doing it), authority (reference leadership), liking (build genuine relationship)"
    - "Say no professionally: explain why, offer alternatives, help prioritize their needs against constraints"
    - "Underpromise and overdeliver: set realistic expectations with buffer, deliver early when possible, build trust through reliability"
    - "Communicate proactively: status updates, risk flagging early, never let stakeholders be surprised by delays or problems"
