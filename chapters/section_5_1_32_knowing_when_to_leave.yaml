# SECTION 32: KNOWING WHEN TO LEAVE
# ============================================================================

knowing_when_to_leave:
  
  philosophy: |
    Most managers stay too long at jobs that aren't working. Fear of change, loyalty 
    to team, golden handcuffs, hope that things will improve. Meanwhile, you're miserable, 
    not growing, and wasting your best career years. Knowing when to leave is critical 
    career skill.
    
    Leaving isn't failure. Sometimes the right answer is "this isn't working and I need 
    to move on." Strategic career moves accelerate growth. Staying in wrong role for 
    loyalty or fear holds you back. Your career is 40+ years - spending 2-3 years in 
    wrong place is costly mistake.

  # Good Reasons to Leave
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  good_reasons_to_leave:
    
    no_longer_learning_or_growing:
      
      signs:
        - "Doing same work for 2+ years with no new challenges"
        - "Mastered role, no room to grow further"
        - "Skills stagnating while industry moves forward"
        - "Bored and unchallenged"
      
      why_this_matters: "Learning trajectory is most important factor in long-term success"
      
      when_to_leave: "If no growth path internally and been trying 6-12 months"
      
      example: |
        You've been detection engineering manager for 3 years. Team is stable, work is 
        routine, no new challenges. Company has no director role for you to grow into. 
        You've built all the things you wanted to build. Time to find bigger challenge.
    
    blocked_promotion_path:
      
      signs:
        - "Ready for promotion but no path (no openings, company structure)"
        - "Repeatedly passed over for promotion despite strong performance"
        - "Would take 5+ years to get promoted internally vs 2 years elsewhere"
        - "Politics preventing advancement"
      
      when_to_leave:
        - "If you're performing at next level for 12+ months with no promotion"
        - "If company has no path (too small, no higher level roles)"
        - "If you've had explicit conversation and timeline is years"
      
      alternative: "Get promoted externally - join new company at higher level"
      
      example: |
        You're ready for director role, performing at that level. Company only has one 
        director position and current person isn't leaving. You could wait 5 years or 
        get director title elsewhere in 6 months.
    
    compensation_significantly_below_market:
      
      signs:
        - "Market data shows you're 30%+ underpaid for level"
        - "Company doesn't adjust despite evidence"
        - "Equity worthless (failed startup, underwater options)"
        - "Can get 50%+ raise by moving"
      
      when_to_leave:
        - "If you've tried negotiating and got nowhere"
        - "If compensation is affecting quality of life"
        - "If company can't/won't pay market rate"
      
      caveat: "Money alone shouldn't drive decision, but significant gap matters"
      
      example: |
        You're paid $150K but market is $200K for your role. Company says budget doesn't 
        allow raises. You have offers for $220K. 47% raise is hard to ignore.
    
    toxic_culture_or_management:
      
      signs:
        - "Unethical behavior tolerated or encouraged"
        - "Toxic manager making your life miserable"
        - "Backstabbing and politics over merit"
        - "Burnout and attrition epidemic"
        - "Your values fundamentally misaligned with company"
      
      when_to_leave: "Immediately if toxic and unlikely to change"
      
      dont_sacrifice_health: "No job worth your mental health or compromising ethics"
      
      example: |
        CISO asks you to hide security issues from board. Leadership tolerates harassment. 
        Multiple good people quit citing culture. This won't get better - leave.
    
    company_failing_or_unstable:
      
      signs:
        - "Multiple rounds of layoffs"
        - "Can't make payroll consistently"
        - "Leadership exodus"
        - "Burning through cash with no revenue"
        - "Obvious the company won't survive"
      
      when_to_leave: "When writing is on wall, not after layoffs start"
      
      loyalty_doesnt_pay: "Going down with ship doesn't help anyone"
      
      example: |
        Startup has 4 months runway, no new funding lined up, missed 3 quarterly goals. 
        Leadership says 'we'll figure it out' but you see the numbers. Start looking now.
    
    work_life_balance_unsustainable:
      
      signs:
        - "Working 70+ hours per week with no end in sight"
        - "Always on-call, never truly off"
        - "Missing family events, relationships suffering"
        - "Health deteriorating from stress"
      
      when_to_leave:
        - "If you've raised concerns and nothing changes"
        - "If culture glorifies overwork"
        - "If your health or relationships are at risk"
      
      life_is_short: "You'll regret missing your kids' childhood more than missing work"
      
      example: |
        You've worked 60-70 hour weeks for 18 months. On-call 24/7. Missed anniversary, 
        kids' events. Talked to manager - told 'that's the job'. Find job that respects 
        your life.
    
    better_opportunity_alignment:
      
      signs:
        - "Dream job offer in area you're passionate about"
        - "Opportunity to work on cutting-edge problems"
        - "Join company whose mission deeply resonates with you"
        - "Role that's perfect next step in your career arc"
      
      when_to_leave: "When opportunity clearly accelerates your career trajectory"
      
      dont_stay_for_loyalty: "Company would replace you if needed - make best decision for you"
      
      example: |
        You get offer to lead detection engineering at company building exactly the 
        platform you've dreamed of. Current role is fine but not exciting. Clear this 
        is better move - take it.

  bad_reasons_to_leave:
    
    one_bad_project_or_quarter:
      
      why_bad: "Every job has rough patches - don't bail at first difficulty"
      
      what_to_do: "See it through, learn from it, give it 6-12 months"
      
      exception: "If it's part of pattern, not isolated incident"
    
    conflict_with_one_person:
      
      why_bad: "Interpersonal conflicts exist everywhere - can't run from them"
      
      what_to_do: "Try to resolve conflict or work with HR - leaving should be last resort"
      
      exception: "If person is abusive and management won't address it"
    
    grass_is_greener_syndrome:
      
      why_bad: "Assuming everywhere else is better when you haven't tried to fix issues"
      
      reality: "Every company has problems - question is whether problems are solvable"
      
      what_to_do: "Identify what's bothering you, try to change it, then decide"
    
    running_from_performance_issues:
      
      why_bad: "Your performance problems will follow you to new job"
      
      reality: "If you're underperforming, switching jobs doesn't fix underlying issue"
      
      what_to_do: "Address performance issues first, then decide if role is wrong fit"
    
    purely_for_title:
      
      why_bad: "Title without growth, interesting work, or compensation is hollow"
      
      example: "Take 'director' title at tiny startup but same scope and less pay"
      
      what_to_do: "Evaluate whole package - title, scope, growth, compensation, company"

        low_learning_high_satisfaction:
          status: "Comfortable but risky long-term"
          action: "Find growth opportunities internally or start looking externally"

        low_learning_low_satisfaction:

      signals:
        should_stay: "Recharged after vacation, excited to return, miss the work"

  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "Good reasons to leave: no longer learning/growing, blocked promotion (performing at next level 12+ months), 30%+ underpaid, toxic culture, company failing, unsustainable work-life balance"
    - "Bad reasons: one bad project (every job has rough patches), single conflict (exists everywhere), grass is greener (try fixing first), running from performance issues"
    - "2x2 framework: High learning + high satisfaction = stay, Low learning + low satisfaction = leave immediately"
    - "Regret minimization: when 80 years old, will you regret staying or leaving? Usually regret staying too long more than leaving too soon"
    - "Trial separation: take 2 weeks off fully disconnected - if you dread returning, time to leave"
    - "Resignation: 2 weeks notice (3-4 for senior roles), be direct and professional, don't over-explain or trash company"
    - "Counter-offers: 70% who accept leave within 12 months - accept only if addresses actual reason you're leaving (not just money for culture issues)"
    - "Transition well: document everything, train replacement, tie up loose ends, be professional until end - security is small world"
    - "Exit interview: be honest but diplomatic, constructive feedback, don't burn bridges - you might want to return someday"
    - "After leaving: don't obsess over old company, give new role 6-12 months fair chance, learn from experience"
    - "Remember: leaving isn't failure, strategic career moves accelerate growth, your career is 40+ years - don't waste years in wrong place"
