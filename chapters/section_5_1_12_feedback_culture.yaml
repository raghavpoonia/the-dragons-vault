# SECTION 12: FEEDBACK CULTURE
# ============================================================================

feedback_culture:
  
  philosophy: |
    Feedback is the mechanism for growth. Without continuous, honest feedback, people 
    plateau. They repeat mistakes without knowing. They miss opportunities to improve. 
    Great teams have cultures where feedback flows freely in all directions - manager 
    to employee, employee to manager, peer to peer.
    
    Your job as manager: model giving and receiving feedback well. Make it safe to give 
    you feedback. Give feedback frequently and constructively. Build a team where 
    feedback is gift, not punishment.
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Continuous Feedback Model
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  continuous_feedback_model:
    
    philosophy: "Feedback should be continuous, not saved for annual reviews or formal 1-on-1s"
    
    frequency_guidelines:
      
      real_time_feedback:
        when: "Within 24-48 hours of observing something noteworthy (positive or constructive)"
        
        examples:
          positive: "Great job leading that incident response - your communication kept everyone calm and informed"
          constructive: "In that meeting, you interrupted Sarah twice. I need you to let people finish their thoughts."
        
        why_real_time: "Immediate feedback is most effective - context is fresh, behavior can be corrected quickly"
      
      weekly_informal_feedback:
        when: "During regular 1-on-1s"
        what: "Share observations from the week, both positive and areas for improvement"
        
        example: "This week I noticed you've been proactive about asking for help when stuck - that's great. Keep doing that."
      
      monthly_pattern_feedback:
        when: "When you notice patterns over several weeks"
        what: "Point out trends - positive patterns to reinforce or concerning patterns to address"
        
        example: "Over the last month, I've noticed you've been late to 3 team meetings. What's going on?"
      
      quarterly_structured_feedback:
        when: "Quarterly check-ins (lighter version of annual review)"
        what: "More comprehensive review of performance, progress on goals, development"
    
    dont_save_feedback:
      
      problem: "Manager saves all feedback for annual review"
      
      impact:
        - "No chance to improve during year - feedback comes too late"
        - "Review is full of surprises and hurt feelings"
        - "Person feels blindsided - 'Why didn't you tell me this earlier?'"
        - "Creates anxiety around reviews"
      
      fix: "Give feedback continuously throughout year. Annual review should just summarize what you've already discussed."

  # Radical Candor Framework
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  radical_candor_framework:
    
    definition: "Care personally AND challenge directly (from Kim Scott's book 'Radical Candor')"
    
    two_dimensions:
      
      care_personally:
        what: "Show you care about person as human being, not just worker"
        how:
          - "Get to know them - their interests, goals, challenges"
          - "Show empathy when they're struggling"
          - "Celebrate their wins genuinely"
          - "Support their career growth"
      
      challenge_directly:
        what: "Be willing to tell hard truths, give critical feedback, have difficult conversations"
        how:
          - "Point out problems directly, don't hint or sugarcoat"
          - "Be specific about what needs to change"
          - "Hold people accountable to high standards"
          - "Don't avoid difficult conversations"
    
    four_quadrants:
      
      radical_candor:
        definition: "Care personally + Challenge directly (IDEAL)"
        
        what_it_looks_like: |
          "I care about you and your success, which is why I need to be direct: your code 
          quality has been declining. The last 3 PRs had significant bugs that made it to 
          production. This isn't like you. What's going on? How can I help you get back 
          to the quality I know you're capable of?"
        
        characteristics:
          - "Direct and honest about issues"
          - "Specific examples and impact"
          - "Comes from place of caring and wanting them to succeed"
          - "Offers help and support"
        
        outcome: "Person improves, relationship strengthens, trust builds"
      
      ruinous_empathy:
        definition: "Care personally but DON'T challenge directly (TOO NICE)"
        
        what_it_looks_like: |
          "I know you've been working really hard and I don't want to stress you out 
          more, so... don't worry about those bugs in production. Everyone makes mistakes. 
          You're doing great!"
        
        problem:
          - "Avoiding difficult conversation because you don't want to hurt feelings"
          - "Person doesn't get feedback they need to improve"
          - "Problems fester and get worse"
          - "Eventually forced to fire them (much worse outcome)"
        
        why_managers_do_this:
          - "Want to be liked"
          - "Uncomfortable with conflict"
          - "Fear person will be upset"
          - "Think being nice means avoiding hard truths"
        
        outcome: "Person doesn't improve, eventually fails, then blames you for not telling them earlier"
      
      obnoxious_aggression:
        definition: "Challenge directly but DON'T care personally (TOO HARSH)"
        
        what_it_looks_like: |
          "Your code is garbage. The bugs in production are embarrassing. What were you 
          thinking? Do better or you're out."
        
        problem:
          - "Feedback is harsh and demoralizing"
          - "No empathy or support"
          - "Attacks person, not behavior"
          - "Creates fear, not growth"
        
        characteristics:
          - "Harsh tone, personal attacks"
          - "No empathy or understanding of context"
          - "Focused on criticism without help"
          - "Makes person feel small"
        
        outcome: "Person feels attacked, defensive, resentful. May improve out of fear but relationship damaged."
      
      manipulative_insincerity:
        definition: "Neither care nor challenge (WORST)"
        
        what_it_looks_like: |
          [Says nothing about bugs to their face]
          [Complains to other managers: "Yeah, Bob's code quality is terrible"]
          [Eventually gives poor review with no prior feedback]
        
        problem:
          - "Political, passive-aggressive"
          - "No direct feedback"
          - "Talking about person, not to person"
          - "Completely dysfunctional"
        
        outcome: "Person blindsided by review, trust destroyed, they quit or get fired"
    
    how_to_practice_radical_candor:
      
      build_relationship_first:
        - "Can't challenge directly if you haven't shown you care"
        - "Spend time getting to know them as person"
        - "Show genuine interest in their success"
        - "Build trust through consistency"
      
      then_challenge_directly:
        - "Once relationship established, give honest feedback"
        - "Be specific about behavior and impact"
        - "Explain why you're telling them (because you care)"
        - "Offer support to help them improve"
      
      example_progression:
        month_1: "Building relationship - learning about them, showing you care"
        month_2: "First minor feedback - test if they receive it well"
        month_3: "More direct feedback on bigger issues - relationship can handle it"
        month_6: "Can have very direct conversations because trust is strong"

  # Giving Effective Feedback

  giving_effective_feedback:
    
    situation_behavior_impact_framework:
      
      situation:
        what: "Describe when and where you observed the behavior"
        why: "Provides context, makes it concrete and specific"
        example: "In yesterday's sprint planning meeting"
      
      behavior:
        what: "Describe specific observable behavior, not interpretation"
        why: "Factual, not judgmental. Can't argue with what you observed."
        
        good: "You interrupted Sarah three times while she was explaining her approach"
        bad: "You were rude to Sarah" (this is interpretation, not behavior)
      
      impact:
        what: "Explain the impact of the behavior"
        why: "Helps them understand why it matters"
        
        example: "Sarah stopped sharing her ideas. After the meeting, she told me she felt her input wasn't valued. This is a problem because we need her expertise on this project."
      
      full_example: |
        Situation: "In yesterday's sprint planning meeting"
        Behavior: "You interrupted Sarah three times while she was explaining her approach"
        Impact: "Sarah stopped sharing her ideas and later told me she felt her input wasn't 
        valued. We need her expertise on this project, and when people feel dismissed, they 
        stop contributing. I need you to let people finish their thoughts before responding."
    
    positive_feedback_matters:
      
      why: "Not just for morale - reinforces behaviors you want to see more of"
      
      be_specific:
        vague: "Great job on that detection!"
        specific: "Your detection for credential dumping was excellent - you caught an edge case with LSASS memory reading that I hadn't considered, and your documentation made it easy for SOC to investigate. This is exactly the quality I want to see."
      
      immediate:
        - "Give positive feedback as soon as you observe great work"
        - "Don't wait for 1-on-1 or review"
        - "Can be Slack message, quick hallway conversation, or shout-out in team meeting"
      
      public_vs_private:
        public: "Praise in public (team meeting, Slack channel) for work that impacts team"
        private: "Praise in 1-on-1 for personal growth or sensitive topics"
    
    critical_feedback_guidelines:
      
      private_always:
        - "NEVER give critical feedback in public"
        - "Always 1-on-1, private space"
        - "Don't cc others on critical feedback emails"
      
      timely:
        - "Within 24-48 hours of observing issue"
        - "Don't let it fester"
        - "But also don't give feedback when angry - wait until you're calm"
      
      specific_not_general:
        general: "You need to communicate better"
        specific: "In that stakeholder meeting, you used too much jargon. The VP looked confused but didn't ask questions. Next time, explain in business terms first, then technical details if asked."
      
      focus_on_behavior_not_person:
        attacking_person: "You're careless and sloppy"
        describing_behavior: "The last three detections you shipped had bugs that caused production incidents. I need you to test more thoroughly before deploying."
      
      explain_impact:
        - "Don't just say what's wrong - explain why it matters"
        - "Connect behavior to impact on team, project, or company"
        - "Helps them understand importance"
      
      collaborative_not_dictatorial:
        dictatorial: "Stop doing X. Do Y instead. That's an order."
        collaborative: "Here's the issue I observed. Here's the impact. What do you think we should do differently? How can I help?"
      
      end_with_support:
        - "After delivering feedback, offer help"
        - "What support do you need to improve this?"
        - "How can I help you succeed?"
