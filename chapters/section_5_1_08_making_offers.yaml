making_offers_and_negotiation:
  
  philosophy: |
    Making an offer is not the end of the hiring process - it's the beginning of 
    negotiation. Strong candidates have options. Your goal is to make a compelling 
    offer that's fair to both sides while leaving room for negotiation. Understand 
    market rates, know your constraints, and negotiate professionally.

  # Understanding Market Compensation
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  understanding_market_compensation:
    
    data_sources:
      levels_fyi: "Best for tech company data, crowdsourced, free"
      radford_comptryx: "Formal compensation surveys, expensive but comprehensive"
      peer_network: "Ask other hiring managers what they're paying"
      recruiters: "External recruiters know current market rates"
    
    factors_affecting_compensation:
      
      location:
        san_francisco_bay_area: "Highest compensation, 100% of benchmark"
        new_york_seattle: "90-100% of SF rates"
        austin_denver_boston: "80-90% of SF rates"
        remote_tier_2_city: "70-85% of SF depending on company policy"
        
        note: "Remote compensation varies by company - some pay SF rates anywhere, others adjust for location"
      
      company_stage:
        faang_tier_1: "Top of market, 90th+ percentile, total comp heavily weighted to base + RSUs"
        public_tech_companies: "70-90th percentile, mix of base + RSUs + bonus"
        series_c_plus_startups: "60-80th percentile cash + more equity (higher risk)"
        series_a_b_startups: "50-70th percentile cash + significant equity (high risk/reward)"
        
        equity_risk_tradeoff: "Earlier stage = more equity, less cash, higher risk but higher potential upside"
      
      role_level:
        junior_l3:
          base_salary: "$90K-$130K"
          total_comp: "$100K-$150K"
          note: "Junior roles have less variation, more standardized"
        
        mid_level_l4:
          base_salary: "$130K-$170K"
          total_comp: "$150K-$200K"
          note: "Mid-level is most common hiring level"
        
        senior_l5:
          base_salary: "$170K-$220K"
          total_comp: "$200K-$280K"
          note: "Senior roles have more negotiation room"
        
        staff_l6:
          base_salary: "$220K-$300K"
          total_comp: "$280K-$400K+"
          note: "Staff+ compensation highly variable, depends on company and scope"
        
        principal_l7:
          base_salary: "$270K-$400K+"
          total_comp: "$350K-$600K+"
          note: "Very few companies have principal level, compensation varies wildly"
        
        market_note: "These are 2024-2025 US market rates for security roles. Adjust for inflation and geography."
    
    components_of_total_compensation:
      
      base_salary:
        what: "Guaranteed cash compensation per year, paid bi-weekly or monthly"
        typical_percentage: "60-80% of total compensation for senior roles"
        negotiability: "Moderate - usually 5-15% flexibility from initial offer"
        
        considerations:
          - "Base affects 401k match, bonuses (often calculated as % of base)"
          - "More important for people with financial obligations (mortgage, kids)"
          - "Affects future raises (usually % of base)"
      
      annual_bonus:
        what: "Annual performance-based cash payment"
        typical_range: "10-20% of base for IC roles, 20-40% for management"
        structure: "Target bonus (e.g., 15% of base) with multiplier based on company and individual performance"
        
        calculation_example:
          base_salary: "$150K"
          target_bonus: "15% = $22.5K"
          company_performance: "120% (exceeded goals)"
          individual_performance: "110% (exceeded expectations)"
          actual_bonus: "$22.5K × 1.20 × 1.10 = $29.7K"
        
        negotiability: "Low - usually set by level, not individually negotiable"
        
        note: "Some companies (especially startups) don't offer bonuses for IC roles - all cash is in base"
      
      equity:
        what: "Stock options or RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)"
        typical_percentage: "20-40% of total comp for public companies, higher for startups"
        vesting_schedule: "Usually 4 years with 1-year cliff (nothing vests until year 1, then monthly or quarterly)"
        
        equity_types:
          
          rsus_restricted_stock_units:
            where: "Public companies"
            what: "Actual stock that vests over time, becomes yours when vested"
            value: "Clear - multiply shares by current stock price"
            taxation: "Taxed as income when vested (at current stock price)"
            risk: "Stock could go down, but always has some value"
            
            example:
              grant: "1000 RSUs over 4 years"
              vesting: "250 shares per year (after 1-year cliff)"
              current_stock_price: "$200/share"
              value_year_1: "250 shares × $200 = $50K vests"
              value_if_stock_doubles: "250 shares × $400 = $100K (you gain $50K)"
              value_if_stock_halves: "250 shares × $100 = $25K (you lose $25K but still something)"
          
          stock_options:
            where: "Private companies, some public companies"
            what: "Right to buy stock at strike price (price when granted)"
            value: "Depends on future stock price vs strike price"
            taxation: "Complex - can trigger AMT, taxed at exercise and sale"
            risk: "Could be worthless if company doesn't succeed or stock price below strike"
            
            example:
              grant: "10,000 options with $10 strike price, 4-year vest"
              vesting: "2,500 options per year"
              ipo_scenario:
                ipo_price: "$50/share"
                your_gain: "(50 - 10) × 10,000 = $400K gain (on paper)"
              
              failure_scenario:
                company_shuts_down: "Options worth $0"
              
              underwater_scenario:
                stock_price_drops_to: "$5/share"
                result: "Options underwater (strike $10 > price $5), worthless"
        
        negotiability: "High - often 20-50% flexibility from initial offer"
        
        how_to_think_about_equity:
          public_company: "Treat as near-cash with volatility - real liquid value"
          late_stage_startup: "50-70% chance of some value, likely smaller than hoped"
          early_stage_startup: "Lottery ticket - could be $0 or life-changing, probably $0"
      
      sign_on_bonus:
        what: "One-time cash payment upon starting (usually paid in first paycheck)"
        typical_range: "$10K-$50K depending on level and what you're forfeiting"
        purpose: "Make up for equity or bonus you're leaving behind at current company"
        negotiability: "High if you're forfeiting significant compensation"
        
        when_to_ask:
          - "Forfeiting >$50K in unvested equity by leaving"
          - "Forfeiting annual bonus by leaving mid-year"
          - "Need to relocate and incur costs"
          - "Have competing offer with higher cash"
        
        how_much_to_ask:
          calculate_what_youre_forfeiting: "Add up unvested equity + prorated bonus"
          ask_for_50_to_100_percent: "Reasonable to ask for 50-100% of what you're forfeiting"
          
          example:
            unvested_equity: "$80K over next 2 years"
            prorated_bonus: "$15K if you left mid-year"
            total_forfeiting: "$95K"
            reasonable_ask: "$40K-$80K sign-on bonus"
      
      benefits:
        what: "Health insurance, 401k match, PTO, parental leave, etc"
        typical_value: "$10K-$30K per year depending on company"
        negotiability: "Low - usually standard for all employees"
        
        common_benefits:
          - "Health/dental/vision insurance (company pays 70-100%)"
          - "401k match (0-6% of salary, often 50% match up to 6%)"
          - "PTO (15-25 days per year for US, unlimited at some companies)"
          - "Parental leave (0-20 weeks paid depending on company)"
          - "Learning budget ($1K-$5K per year)"
        
        note: "Don't focus negotiation on benefits - focus on cash and equity"

  # Constructing Initial Offer
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  constructing_initial_offer:
    
    philosophy: "Make a strong but not final offer - competitive enough to excite them, with room to negotiate"
    
    approach:
      - "Start at 60-70th percentile for level (not low-ball, not ceiling)"
      - "Leave 10-15% room for negotiation on base and equity"
      - "Be prepared to justify level if candidate questions it"
      - "Don't anchor too low - insults strong candidates who have options"
    
    example_offer_l4_detection_engineer:
      level: "L4 (Mid-level Detection Engineer)"
      location: "San Francisco Bay Area"
      
      initial_offer:
        base_salary: "$145K"
        bonus_target: "15% = $21.75K"
        equity_grant: "$60K RSUs over 4 years ($15K/year)"
        total_comp_year_1: "$181.75K"
      
      negotiation_room:
        can_go_to_base: "$160K (10% increase)"
        can_go_to_equity: "$80K over 4 years (33% increase)"
        max_total_comp: "$205K if needed"
      
      rationale: "Competitive offer at 65th percentile with room to negotiate to 80th percentile if needed"
    
    offer_letter_components:
      must_include:
        - "Role title and level"
        - "Base salary (annual)"
        - "Bonus target and how it's calculated"
        - "Equity grant with vesting schedule"
        - "Start date (or date flexibility)"
        - "Benefits summary or link to benefits guide"
        - "Contingent on background check and references"
        - "At-will employment (in US)"
        - "Expiration date (usually 5-7 days)"
      
      tone: "Enthusiastic and welcoming, not bureaucratic"
      
      example_opening: |
        "We're excited to offer you the Detection Engineer position at [Company]! 
        The team was really impressed with your detection engineering background and 
        problem-solving approach. We think you'd be a great addition to the team."

  # Negotiation Tactics
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  negotiation_tactics:
    
    expect_negotiation:
      reality: "70-80% of candidates negotiate, especially for senior roles"
      mindset: "Negotiation is normal and healthy - shows confidence and understanding of their value"
      red_flag: "If candidate accepts immediately without any questions, might lack confidence or have no other options"
    
    common_negotiation_requests:
      
      base_salary_increase:
        example_request: "I was hoping for $170K base instead of $145K"
        
        how_to_respond:
          step_1_understand_why:
            questions_to_ask:
              - "What's driving this request? Current salary, other offers, market research?"
              - "Tell me about your current compensation - what are you making now?"
              - "What other offers are you considering? How do they compare?"
          
          step_2_evaluate:
            - "Is $170K within budget for this level?"
            - "If yes: Can we meet request without breaking internal equity?"
            - "If no: What's our max for this level and how close can we get?"
          
          step_3_respond:
            
            if_within_range:
              response: |
                "I hear you on $170K. Let me see what I can do. Given your experience 
                and the market, I can go to $165K base. Above that, we'd be at L5 
                compensation without L5 scope and responsibilities. Would $165K work?"
              
              rationale: "Show flexibility, explain constraints clearly, don't just say yes immediately"
            
            if_outside_range:
              response: |
                "I understand $170K is what you're looking for. Here's our constraint: 
                that's L5 compensation at our company, and this role is scoped as L4. 
                I can go to $155K base, which is top of L4 range. I can also increase 
                equity to $75K over 4 years. That puts total comp at ~$195K first year, 
                which is strong for this level. Would that work?"

            - "What's your best estimate of value? (for private companies)"
          
          equity_is_more_flexible:
            - "Equity is usually more flexible than base salary"
            - "Can often increase 20-40% without additional approvals"
            - "Especially if candidate is forfeiting significant equity"

            sign-on bonus to cover some of the near-term equity you're forfeiting.

            6 months if you're performing at that level. I'll give you L5-scope projects 
            to prove yourself. Fair?"
    
    negotiation_red_flags:
      
      unrealistic_demands:
        example: "I want $350K for L4 role" (when market is $180-200K)
        problem: "2x market rate - shows poor understanding of value or trying to game system"
        response: "That's significantly above market for this level and our budget. Our best offer is $195K total comp. If that doesn't work, I understand, but we can't go to $350K."
        decision: "Usually walk away - candidate either misinformed or trying to extract unreasonable comp"
      
      aggressive_or_disrespectful:
        example: "You're lowballing me. This offer is insulting. Do better."
        problem: "Poor communication style, will be difficult to work with"
        response: "I'm sorry you feel that way. Our offer is competitive for the market and level. I'm happy to explain our compensation philosophy, but we can't go significantly higher. If the tone of this conversation continues, I'll need to withdraw the offer."
        decision: "Consider rescinding offer if behavior continues - bad culture fit"
      
      excessive_back_and_forth:
        example: "10+ rounds of negotiation, moving goalposts each time"
        problem: "Will be difficult to work with, indecisive, possibly just fishing"
        response: "I've made our best and final offer at $200K total comp. I need a decision by [date]. Let me know if you have questions, but this is where we are."
        decision: "Set deadline, stick to it, be prepared to walk away"
      
      lying_about_competing_offers:
        example: "Claims $300K offer but vague on details, can't or won't share offer letter"
        problem: "Integrity issue - if they'll lie in negotiation, they'll lie on the job"
        response: "I'd love to see the offer letter to understand the comparison. If you're not comfortable sharing it, I understand, but I can't adjust our offer without seeing it."
        decision: "If you suspect lying and they won't provide proof, walk away - integrity matters"
