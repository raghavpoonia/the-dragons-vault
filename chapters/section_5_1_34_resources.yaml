  philosophy: |
    This chapter covers a lot, but it's just the beginning. Management is learned 
    through practice, reflection, and continuous study. These resources - books, blogs, 
    communities, tools - have shaped my thinking and will accelerate your growth.
    
    Don't try to read everything. Pick 2-3 books that resonate with your current 
    challenges. Join one community. Follow a few blogs. Learn iteratively as you face 
    real situations, then come back to these resources for deeper understanding.
