# SECTION 11: PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
# ============================================================================

performance_management:
  
  philosophy: |
    Performance management is not an annual event - it's a continuous process of goal 
    setting, feedback, coaching, and development. The annual review is just a summary 
    of conversations you've been having all year. If the performance review contains 
    surprises, you've failed as a manager.
    
    Done well, performance management helps people grow, aligns work with impact, and 
    creates accountability. Done poorly, it's bureaucratic box-checking that creates 
    anxiety and resentment.

    typical_annual_cycle:
      
      q1_january_march:
        activity: "Set annual goals collaboratively with each person"
        timing: "First 2-3 weeks of Q1"
        
        process:
          - "Employee drafts goals based on team roadmap and their development areas"
          - "Manager reviews and refines with them"
          - "Align on 3-5 goals for the year with clear metrics"
          - "Document in performance management system"
      
      q2_april_june:
        activity: "Mid-year check-in on goals and performance"
        timing: "End of Q2"
        
        process:
          - "Review progress on annual goals (on track? needs adjustment?)"
          - "Provide feedback on first half performance"
          - "Adjust goals if priorities have changed"
          - "Identify any performance concerns early"
        
        importance: "Catch issues at 6 months, not 12 months when it's too late to fix"
      
      q3_july_september:
        activity: "Performance tracking and informal feedback"
        timing: "Throughout Q3"
        
        process:
          - "Continue regular 1-on-1s with ongoing feedback"
          - "Track examples of great work and areas for improvement"
          - "No formal review, just continuous coaching"
      
      q4_october_december:
        activity: "Annual performance review"
        timing: "Usually November/December"
        
        process:
          week_1: "Send self-review template to employees"
          week_2: "Collect peer feedback (360 reviews if your company does them)"
          week_3: "Manager writes performance reviews"
          week_4: "Calibration meetings with other managers"
          week_5: "Deliver reviews to employees in 1-on-1s"
        
        note: "Timeline compresses around holidays - start early"
    
    continuous_feedback_model:
      
      philosophy: "Don't save feedback for annual review - give it continuously"
      
      real_time_feedback:
        when: "Within 24-48 hours of observing something (good or concerning)"
        what: "Specific behavior or action, impact, what to keep doing or change"
        where: "1-on-1, Slack DM, or quick hallway conversation depending on urgency and sensitivity"
      
      monthly_informal_check_ins:
        what: "Brief conversation about how things are going overall"
        questions:
          - "How are you feeling about your work?"
          - "What's going well?"
          - "What's challenging?"
          - "Am I supporting you effectively?"
      
      quarterly_deeper_reviews:
        what: "More structured review of performance and goals"
        format: "Use similar structure to annual review but lighter weight"
        benefit: "No surprises at annual review - they know where they stand"

          Alice had an exceptional year, significantly exceeding all goals and making 
          multiplier impact on the team. She shipped 65 detections (vs 40 goal), reduced 
          deployment time from 2 weeks to 2 days, and mentored 2 engineers who both got

          Goal: Ship 40 production detections with <5% false positive rate
          
          Achievement: Shipped 65 detections with average 2.8% FP rate
          
          Evidence:
          - Q1: 15 detections (vs 10 planned)
          - Q2: 20 detections (vs 15 planned)
          - Q3: 18 detections (vs 10 planned)
          - Q4: 12 detections (vs 5 planned)
          - FP rate tracked monthly, never exceeded 4%, average 2.8%

        be_specific: "Don't just say 'great communicator' - show HOW they communicated well"
        
        example: |
          Technical Excellence: Built detection platform automation that reduced deployment 
          time from 2 weeks to 2 days. The pipeline includes automated testing, git workflow, 
          and one-command deployment. Other teams are now adopting this approach.
          
          Mentorship: Mentored Sarah and Tom (both junior engineers). Sarah shipped her first 
          production detection within 3 weeks of starting. Tom improved his code quality 
          significantly - his PR reviews went from 10+ comments to 2-3. Both got promoted 
          this year, partly due to her mentorship.

        framing: "Not deficiencies, but opportunities to grow to next level"
        
        example: |
          Strategic Communication: While Alice is excellent at explaining technical topics, 
          she could improve at framing work in business terms for executives. For example, 
          when presenting detection metrics, focus on business impact (prevented breaches, 
          compliance coverage) rather than just technical metrics (# of detections, FP rate). 
          This will be important for senior/staff level.

        what: "Final summary with rating and justification"
        
        example: |
          Alice had an exceptional year. She exceeded all goals by significant margins, 
          made the entire team more productive through automation, and elevated others 
          through mentorship. Her work resulted in both internal impact (team productivity) 
          and external visibility (conference talk, open-source). She's operating above her 
          current level and is ready for promotion to L5.

  # Calibration Process
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  calibration_process:
    
    what_it_is: "Managers meet to review performance ratings and ensure consistency across team"
    
    why_it_matters:
      - "Prevents manager bias (too harsh or too lenient)"
      - "Ensures fairness across organization"
      - "Creates consistent bar for ratings"
      - "Protects against legal challenges"
    
    who_attends: "All managers at same level + their manager (director/VP)"
    
    process:
      
      step_1_prepare:
        - "Each manager prepares summary of their ratings distribution"
        - "Have specific examples ready for top and bottom performers"
        - "Know your justification for each rating"
      
      step_2_review_distributions:
        - "Share rating distributions across teams"
        - "Identify outliers (one manager has 50% exceeds, another has 5%)"
        - "Discuss whether distributions make sense given team composition"
      
      step_3_discuss_edge_cases:
        focus_on:
          - "People on borderline between ratings (meets vs exceeds)"
          - "People getting low ratings (does not meet, partially meets)"
          - "People getting promoted"
        
        each_manager_presents:
          - "Here's the rating I'm recommending"
          - "Here's the evidence (goals achieved, impact, examples)"
          - "Here's why this rating vs one above or below"
        
        group_discusses:
          - "Is this consistent with how we've rated others?"
          - "Is evidence strong enough for this rating?"
          - "Should rating be adjusted up or down?"
      
      step_4_adjust_and_finalize:
        - "Managers adjust ratings based on calibration discussion"
        - "Final ratings locked after calibration"
        - "Deliver reviews to employees within week"
    
    calibration_tips:
      
      fight_for_your_top_performers:
        - "Bring strong evidence for 'exceeds' ratings"
        - "Compare to others getting 'exceeds' - is your person as strong?"
        - "Don't back down if you truly believe they deserve it"
      
      be_honest_about_poor_performers:
        - "Don't inflate ratings to avoid difficult conversation"
        - "Other managers will see through it in calibration"
        - "You're doing person disservice by not being honest"
      
      learn_from_other_managers:
        - "See what 'exceeds' looks like on other teams"
        - "Calibrate your expectations based on org standards"
        - "Use calibration to improve your own evaluation skills"

        example: "You had a great year. You met all your goals, shipped quality work consistently, and were a reliable team member. Your rating is Meets Expectations, which reflects solid performance."
      
      walk_through_review:
        - "Go through each goal and how they did"

  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "Performance management is continuous, not annual - reviews summarize year-long conversations"
    - "If review contains surprises, you've failed as manager - feedback should be continuous"
    - "Goal setting: 3-5 SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)"
    - "Goal categories: technical delivery (2-3), impact/influence (1-2), growth/learning (1)"
    - "Rating scale: Exceeds (top 10-20%), Meets (70-80%), Partially Meets (5-10%), Does Not Meet (<5%)"
    - "Exceeds means significantly exceeded goals with multiplier impact, not just 'did good work'"
    - "Meets is expected solid performance - nothing wrong with 'meets', it's what we hired for"
    - "Calibration ensures fairness across organization - fight for your top performers with evidence"
    - "Delivering reviews: 60 min meeting, share summary first, walk through details, discuss comp and next steps"
    - "Handle disagreement professionally: listen, explain evidence, make final call, focus on future"
