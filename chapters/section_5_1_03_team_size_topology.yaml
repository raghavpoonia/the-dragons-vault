# SECTION 03: TEAM SIZE AND TOPOLOGY
# ============================================================================

team_size_and_topology:
  
  core_philosophy:
    concept: |
      Human cognitive limits affect team dynamics. Communication overhead grows exponentially 
      with team size. Each team size has optimal structure and management approach. Growing 
      past these thresholds without structure change causes dysfunction.
      
      Based on research (Dunbar's number) and practical experience, there are natural team 
      size thresholds: 3-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16+. Each requires different management approach.
    
    communication_overhead_math: |
      Number of communication paths = n(n-1)/2 where n = team size
      - Team of 5: 10 communication paths
      - Team of 10: 45 communication paths (4.5x more)
      - Team of 15: 105 communication paths (10.5x more)
      
      This is why large teams need more structure - you can't rely on everyone talking 
      to everyone else.

  # Team of 3-5 People
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  team_of_3_to_5:
    
    characteristics:
      communication_overhead: "Low - everyone can know everything"
      decision_making: "Fast - quick consensus or manager decides"
      specialization: "Minimal - everyone does everything"
      information_sharing: "Happens naturally, no formal processes needed"
      meeting_overhead: "Single team meeting sufficient for coordination"
    
    best_use_case: |
      Early stage teams, tight-knit execution, rapid iteration. Startups, new initiatives 
      within larger company, specialized teams with narrow scope.
    
    manager_role:
      time_allocation:
        people_management: "30%"
        technical_work: "70%"
      
      activities:
        - "Still writing code or detections daily"
        - "Quick 1-on-1s keep everyone aligned (15-30 min weekly)"
        - "Manager knows every detail of every project"
        - "Hands-on code review and technical guidance"
        - "Direct involvement in all technical decisions"
      
      management_style: "Player-coach - leading by example, teaching through doing"
    
    example_structure:
      manager:
        title: "Detection Engineering Manager"
        level: "Usually senior IC (L5) or entry-level manager"
        day_to_day: "Writing detections 50% of time, managing 50%. Still most productive IC on team."
      
      senior_engineer:
        level: "L5"
        role: "Jack-of-all-trades, can handle any problem"
        importance: "Provides technical depth, can operate independently when manager busy"
      
      mid_level_engineer:
        level: "L4"
        role: "Solid contributor, growing into senior"
        trajectory: "Will be L5 in 12-18 months with good mentorship"
      
      junior_engineer:
        level: "L3 or new grad"
        role: "High potential, learning fundamentals"
        trajectory: "Will be L4 in 12-24 months"
    
    team_dynamics:
      strengths:
        - "Everyone knows everything - no information silos or surprises"
        - "Fast decision making - quick alignment, minimal process"
        - "Strong relationships - small team bonds quickly, high trust"
        - "High flexibility - easy to pivot, reassign work"
        - "Clear accountability - nowhere to hide, everyone's contribution visible"
      
      challenges:
        - "Manager stretched thin - juggling technical work and people management"
        - "Single points of failure - only one person knows certain systems"
        - "Hard to take vacation - coverage issues, team struggles without key people"
        - "Limited perspectives - small team means fewer viewpoints"
        - "Scaling issues - as work grows, team hits capacity quickly"
      
      cultural_characteristics:
        - "Feels like family - everyone knows each other personally"
        - "Informal communication - lots of Slack, quick syncs, minimal meetings"
        - "Shared ownership - everyone cares about everything"
        - "Learning happens through osmosis - sit next to senior, absorb knowledge"
    
    required_processes:
      minimal_structure:
        - "Weekly team meeting (30-60 min)"
        - "Weekly 1-on-1s with manager (15-30 min)"
        - "Quarterly goal setting"
        - "That's it - don't over-process"
    
    evolution_trigger:
      signal: "Existing team at capacity, clear need for person 6"
      
      symptoms:
        - "Work is getting dropped or delayed"
        - "Quality suffering because team stretched too thin"
        - "Manager spending >50% time on people management, technical work suffering"
        - "Team working unsustainable hours to keep up"
      
      what_changes: |
        Manager must delegate more, reduce hands-on technical work. Team needs more 
        structure - can't rely on everyone knowing everything. Need to introduce some 
        formal processes.
      
      next_phase: "Team of 6-10"
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Team of 6-10 People
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  team_of_6_to_10:
    
    characteristics:
      communication_overhead: "Medium - need more structure for coordination"
      decision_making: "Slower - need clear ownership and escalation paths"
      specialization: "Emerging - people naturally develop focus areas"
      information_sharing: "Requires intentional effort - can't rely on osmosis"
      meeting_overhead: "Weekly team meeting + subteam/project meetings needed"
    
    best_use_case: |
      Growing teams executing on established roadmap. Company between Series A and C, 
      security team maturing from reactive to proactive.
    
    manager_role:
      time_allocation:
        people_management: "60%"
        technical_work: "40%"
      
      activities:
        - "Less hands-on coding, more architecture and code review"
        - "More time in 1-on-1s and managing coordination between people"
        - "Manager knows high-level details, trusts team for specifics"
        - "Focus shifts to unblocking team, facilitating decisions"
        - "More time on hiring, performance management"
      
      management_style: "Coach more than player - guiding rather than doing"
    
    structure_evolution:
      
      tech_lead_emergence:
        who: "Senior engineer (L5) takes on informal or formal technical leadership"
        
        responsibilities:
          - "Technical decision making for team's projects"
          - "Architecture and design review"
          - "Mentoring other engineers, especially mid-levels"
          - "Breaking down large projects into tasks"
          - "Technical roadmap input"
        
        not_a_people_manager: |
          Tech lead reports to you, focuses purely on technical leadership. No direct 
          reports, no performance reviews, no hiring. Purely technical track.
        
        importance: |
          Without strong tech lead, manager becomes bottleneck for all technical decisions. 
          With strong tech lead, team can move fast on technical matters while manager 
          focuses on people and strategy.
      
      specialization_begins:
        pattern: "People naturally gravitate to areas of interest and expertise"
        
        examples:
          - "Alice becomes 'the cloud detection person' - owns AWS/Azure/GCP detections"
          - "Bob becomes 'the Windows detection expert' - deep knowledge of Windows internals"
          - "Carol focuses on detection platform - infrastructure and tooling"
        
        management_approach: |
          Encourage specialization while maintaining some breadth. Don't let people become 
          so siloed they can't work on anything else. Aim for T-shaped: deep in one area, 
          competent in others.
        
        risk_mitigation:
          - "Document specialized knowledge - bus factor protection"
          - "Rotate people through different areas occasionally"
          - "Pair specialists with generalists for knowledge transfer"
      
      documentation_critical:
        why: "Can't rely on everyone knowing everything. Tribal knowledge doesn't scale."
        
        what_to_document:
          - "System architecture and design decisions (ADRs)"
          - "Detection development process and standards"
          - "Onboarding guides for new team members"
          - "Runbooks for common issues and on-call scenarios"
          - "Technical debt and known issues"
        
        without_this: |
          New hires take 3x longer to ramp up. Knowledge is lost when people leave or 
          change focus areas. Same questions answered repeatedly. Technical debt forgotten 
          until it causes outages.
    
    required_processes:
      
      weekly_team_meeting:
        duration: "60 minutes"
        frequency: "Every week, same time, never cancel"
        
        agenda:
          - "Project updates (5 min each person - what shipped, what's in progress, blockers)"
          - "Blockers and asks (15 min - surface issues, ask for help)"
          - "Technical deep dive (20 min - someone presents technical topic, team learns)"
          - "Announcements (10 min - company updates, process changes, celebrations)"
          - "Open discussion (10 min - anything else on people's minds)"
        
        importance: |
          Primary coordination mechanism. Without this, team fragments. People work in 
          silos, duplicate effort, block each other unknowingly.
      
      clear_ownership:
        system: "Every system, project, and area has DRI (directly responsible individual)"
        
        example_ownership_matrix: |
          System                    | Owner     | Backup
          Detection Library         | Alice     | Bob
          Detection Platform        | Carol     | Alice
          SIEM Integration          | Bob       | Carol
          Cloud Detection (AWS)     | Alice     | Dave
          Endpoint Detection        | Bob       | Alice
        
        benefit: |
          No confusion about who to ask. No dropped balls. Clear accountability. When 
          something breaks, everyone knows who's responsible for fixing it.
      
      one_on_ones:
        frequency: "Weekly or biweekly with everyone on team"
        duration: "30 minutes minimum, 60 for complex discussions"
        
        importance: |
          Can't skip these. Only way to stay connected with everyone as team grows. Where 
          you hear about problems early, provide coaching, build relationships.
        
        structure: "Their time, not yours. They drive agenda. You listen, ask questions, coach, provide context."
      
      quarterly_planning:
        process: "Team roadmap with clear priorities for next 3 months"
        
        involvement: "Everyone contributes ideas. You gather input, synthesize, make final call on priorities."
        
        output: "Shared understanding of what we're building and why. Clear priorities. Everyone knows what success looks like for the quarter."
    
    challenges_at_this_size:
      
      information_silos_forming:
        problem: "Alice knows cloud, Bob knows Windows, Carol knows platform. Minimal overlap. When someone's on vacation, work stops."
        
        mitigation:
          - "Pair programming - Alice pairs with others on cloud work"
          - "Documentation - writeups of how systems work"
          - "Tech talks - specialists teach others their domain"
          - "Rotation - occasionally have people work outside specialty"
      
      coordination_overhead_increasing:
        problem: "More time in meetings, less time building"
        
        mitigation:
          - "Clear ownership reduces need for coordination meetings"
          - "Written communication (RFCs, design docs) instead of meetings when possible"
          - "Time-box meetings ruthlessly"
          - "Default to async communication, meetings only when needed"
      
      manager_becoming_bottleneck:
        problem: "Team waiting on you for decisions, reviews, approvals"
        
        mitigation:
          - "Delegate technical decisions to tech lead"
          - "Empower team to make decisions without you"
          - "Set expectation: if you don't respond in 24 hours, proceed without you"
          - "Be clear about what actually needs your approval vs what doesn't"
    
    evolution_trigger:
      signal: |
        Manager spending >70% time on people management, little time for technical work. 
        Tech debt accumulating from lack of coordination. Quality issues from insufficient 
        oversight.
      
      symptoms:
        - "Manager barely coding anymore, misses it"
        - "Team members don't know what others are working on"
        - "Duplicate work happening because of poor coordination"
        - "Architecture drift - each person building things differently"
        - "New hires struggling to ramp because team too fragmented"
      
      what_changes: |
        Need to split into subteams with clear interfaces. Requires strong senior/staff 
        engineers to lead subteams. Can't just hire more people - need structure first.

    challenges_at_this_size:
      
      manager_technical_depth:
        reality: "Can't maintain detailed technical knowledge across everything"
        acceptance: "You're now managing the machine that builds things, not building directly"
        solution: "Rely on tech leads and staff engineer for technical decisions. Your job is to ensure they have context and alignment."
      
      subteam_divergence:
        problem: "Each subteam develops own practices, tools, approaches"
        manifestation: "Cloud team uses different testing framework than endpoint team. Each has different code review standards."
        solution: "Staff engineer ensures technical coherence. Regular cross-team tech talks. Shared guidelines with room for flexibility."
        balance: "Allow some divergence (good - teams optimize for their domain) but prevent total inconsistency (bad - can't move people between teams)"
      
      coordination_overhead:
        problem: "Work across subteams requires lots of coordination"
        manifestation: "Simple change requires meetings with 3 teams. Dependencies block progress."
        solution: "Clear interfaces between subteams. Minimize dependencies. When dependencies exist, document them clearly and communicate proactively."
      
      losing_personal_connection:
        problem: "Manager can't maintain close relationships with 15 people"
        reality: "You'll have deeper relationships with some than others. That's okay."

      why: "One person cannot effectively manage 16+ people. Period."
      
      reality_check: |
        If you have 16 direct reports:
        - 16 weekly 1-on-1s × 30 min = 8 hours/week just in 1-on-1s
        - Plus hiring, performance reviews, coaching, resolving conflicts, coordination
        - Plus your own manager wants updates from you
        - Plus you're in meetings with other teams
        
        Math doesn't work. Quality of people management suffers. You're spread too thin.

          title: "Senior Manager, Detection Engineering"
          reports: "2 managers + 2-3 staff engineers (dotted line)"
          focus: "Similar to director but more hands-on"
        
        difference_from_director: "Senior manager is typically more hands-on, closer to execution. Director is more strategic, focused on org design and long-term planning."
    
    critical_success_factors:
      
      clear_interface_boundaries:
        why: "Without clear interfaces, constant coordination needed between subteams"
        
        how_to_achieve:
          - "Well-defined APIs between subteams"
          - "Clear ownership of systems"
          - "Documented dependencies"
          - "Service-level agreements (SLAs) for cross-team requests"
        
        example: |
          Detection Platform team provides detection deployment API. Detection Development 
          team uses that API. Interface is documented, versioned, with SLA of <24 hour 
          deployment time. Changes to API require RFC and migration plan.
      
      regular_manager_syncs:
        frequency: "Weekly sync between all managers"
        attendees: "You + managers + senior staff engineers"
        purpose: "Alignment, escalations, shared learning, cross-team coordination"
        
        agenda:
          - "Org health (hiring, attrition, morale)"
          - "Cross-team dependencies and blockers"
          - "Upcoming changes affecting multiple teams"
          - "Share learnings and best practices"
      
      shared_on_call_or_coordination:
        challenge: "Can't have completely separate on-call for each subteam (people would never not be on-call)"
        
        solutions:
          option_1: "Shared on-call rotation across all engineers, regardless of subteam"
          option_2: "Follow-the-sun with regional teams if distributed"
          option_3: "Tiered on-call (L1 team → specialist subteams for escalation)"
        
        choose_based_on: "Team distribution, company size, incident volume, team preferences"
      
      staff_plus_ensuring_coherence:
        without_this: "Each subteam becomes siloed, builds incompatible systems, can't share code or learnings"
        
        role_of_staff_engineers:
          - "Architect systems that span subteams"
          - "Review designs from all subteams for consistency"
          - "Drive cross-team technical initiatives"
          - "Mentor senior engineers across organization"
          - "Represent technical perspective in strategic planning"
        
        importance: "Staff+ engineers are the glue that keeps large org technically coherent"

  # Team Topology Patterns
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  team_topology_patterns:
    
    feature_teams:
      definition: "Teams organized around product features or capabilities they own"
      
      examples:
        - "Detection Engineering Team - owns detection library"
        - "Incident Response Team - owns IR process"
        - "Cloud Security Team - owns cloud security"
      
      advantages:
        - "Clear ownership and accountability"
        - "Deep expertise in domain"
        - "Easy to measure team success"
        - "Strong team identity and culture"
      
      disadvantages:
        - "Potential silos between teams"
        - "Duplicated infrastructure work"
        - "Handoffs between teams for complex issues"
      
      best_for: "Most security organizations 10-100 people"
    
    platform_teams:
      definition: "Teams that build platforms and tools for other teams to use"
      
      examples:
        - "Security Data Platform - builds logging infrastructure everyone uses"
        - "Detection Framework - builds detection-as-code platform"
      
      advantages:
        - "Reduce duplication across teams"
        - "Enable other teams to move faster"
        - "Force multiplier effect"
      
      disadvantages:
        - "Success depends on adoption (political challenge)"
        - "Harder to measure direct impact"
        - "Can become disconnected from real problems"
      
      best_for: "Mature organizations with 50+ security engineers where duplication pain is significant"
    
    matrix_structure:
      definition: "Engineers report to one manager but work on another team's priorities"
      
      example: "Detection engineers report to Detection Manager but embedded in product teams"
      
      advantages:
        - "Security embedded early in product development"
        - "Close collaboration with product teams"
      
      disadvantages:
        - "Confused accountability - two bosses"
        - "Competing priorities"
        - "Career development challenges"
      
      best_for: "Almost never - very hard to make work well"
      
      dragons_advice: |
        Avoid matrix unless you have very strong organizational reason and executive 
        support. I've seen it work once out of ten attempts. The confusion and stress 
        on engineers is rarely worth the benefits. Better to have dedicated security 
        team that partners closely with product teams.
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Key Takeaways
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  key_takeaways:
    - "Communication overhead grows exponentially with team size (n(n-1)/2)"
    - "Each size threshold (3-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16+) requires different structure"
    - "Team of 3-5: Manager is player-coach, minimal process, everyone knows everything"
    - "Team of 6-10: Need tech lead, specialization emerges, documentation critical"
    - "Team of 11-15: Must split into subteams, need strong L5/staff engineers, formal processes"
    - "Team of 16+: Add management layer, you manage managers, staff engineers ensure coherence"
    - "Don't grow past threshold without structure change - dysfunction guaranteed"
    - "Feature teams work best for most security orgs, platform teams for large mature orgs"
    - "Avoid matrix structure unless absolutely necessary with strong exec support"
    - "If managing 16+ people directly, you're doing it wrong - add management layer"
