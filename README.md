## 📖 About This Manual

The Dragon's Vault is a comprehensive manual for security practitioners, from SOC analysts to security engineering leaders. Born from 13 years of building detection systems, managing incidents, leading teams, and making every mistake in the book (so you don't have to).

**This is not theory.** Every framework, every checklist, every anti-pattern comes from production systems protecting hundreds of thousands of endpoints, real security incidents, and the messy reality of building security teams.

## 🎯 Who This Is For

- **SOC Analysts** transitioning to detection engineering
- **Detection Engineers** building detection-as-code platforms

- **Security Automation Engineers** scaling security operations
- **First-time Managers** learning to lead security teams
- **Senior Managers** scaling from 5 to 50+ people
- **Anyone** who wants to level up their security operations game
